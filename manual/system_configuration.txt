System configuration
####################

There are manifold principal approaches to configure different aspects of
an operating system and the applications running on top.
At the lowest level, there exists the opportunity to pass configuration
information to the boot loader. This information may be evaluated
directly by the boot loader or passed to the booted system. As an
example for the former, some boot loaders allow for setting up a
graphics mode depending on its configuration. Hence, the graphics mode
to be used by the OS could be defined right at this early stage
of booting. More prominently, however, is the mere passing of configuration
information to the booted OS, i.e., in the form of a kernel command line or as
command-line arguments to boot modules. The OS would interpret
boot-loader-provided data structures (i.e., multiboot info structures) to
obtain such information. Most kernels interpret certain configuration
arguments passed via this mechanism.
At the OS-initialization level, before any drivers are functioning,
the OS behavior is typically steered by configuration information
provided along with the kernel image, i.e., an initial file-system
image (initrd). On Linux-based systems, this information comes in the
form of configuration files and init scripts located at well-known
locations within the initial file-system image.
Higher up the software stack, configuration becomes an even more diverse
topic. I.e., the runtime behavior of a GNU/Linux-based system is
defined by a conglomerate of configuration files, daemons and their
respective command-line arguments, environment variables, collections
of symlinks, and plenty of heuristics.

The diversity and complexity of configuration mechanisms, however, is
problematic for high-assurance computing. To attain a high level of
assurance, Genode's architecture must be complemented by a low-complexity
yet scalable configuration concept.
The design of this concept takes the following considerations into account.

:Uniformity across platforms:
  To be applicable across a variety of kernels and hardware platforms, the
  configuration mechanism must not rely on a particular kernel or boot loader.
  Even though boot loaders for x86-based machines usually support the
  multiboot specification and thereby the ability to supplement boot modules
  with additional command lines, boot loaders on ARM-based platforms
  generally lack this ability. Furthermore, even if a multiboot compliant
  boot loader is used, the kernel - once started - must provide a way to
  reflect the boot information to the system on top, which is not the case
  for most microkernels.

:Low complexity:
  The configuration mechanism is an intrinsic part of each component. Hence,
  it affects to the trusted computing base of every Genode-based system.
  For this reason, the mechanism must be easy to understand and implementable
  without the need for complex underlying OS infrastructure. As a negative
  example, the provision of configuration files via a file system would
  require each Genode-based system to support the notion of a file system
  and to define the naming of configuration files.

:Expressiveness:
  Passing configuration information as command-line arguments to components
  at their creation time seems like a natural way to avoid the complexity
  of a file-based configuration mechanism.
  However, whereas command-line arguments are the tried and tested way for
  supplying program arguments in a concise way, the expressiveness
  of the approach is limited. In particular, it is ill-suited for expressing
  structured information as often found in configurations.
  Furthermore, being a component-based system, Genode requires a way to
  express relationships between components, which lends itself to the
  use of a structural representation.

:Common syntax:
  The requirement of a low-complexity mechanism mandates a common syntax
  across components. Otherwise, each component would need to  come with a
  custom parser. Each of those parsers would eventually inflate the
  complexity of the trusted computing base. In contrast, a common syntax
  that is both expressive and simple to parse, helps to avoid such
  redundancies by using a single parser implementation across all components.

:Least privilege:
  Being the guiding motive behind Genode's architecture, the principle of
  least privilege needs to be applied to the access of configuration
  information. Each component needs to be able to access its own configuration
  but must not observe configuration information about unrelated components.
  A system-global registry of configurations or even a global namespace of
  keys for such a database would violate this principle.

:Accommodation of dynamic workloads:
  Supplying configuration information at the construction time of a component
  is not sufficient for long-living components, whose behavior might need to
  be adapted at runtime.
  For example, the assignment of resources to the clients of a resource
  multiplexer might change over the lifetime of the resource multiplexer.
  Hence, the configuration concept should provide a means to update
  the configuration information of a component after its construction time.

Nested configuration concept
============================

Genode's configuration concept is based on the ROM session interface described
in Section [Read-only memory (ROM)]. In contrast to a file system interface,
the ROM session interface, is extremely simple. The client of a ROM service
specifies the requested ROM module by its name, prior known by the client.
There neither a way to query a list of available ROM modules, nor are ROM
modules organized in a hierarchic name space.

[tikz img/nested_config]
  Nested system configuration

The ROM session interface is implemented by core's ROM service to make boot
modules available to other components. Those boot modules comprise the
executable binaries of the init component as well as those of the components
created by init. Furthermore, a ROM module called "config" contains the
configuration of the init process in an XML format. To obtain its
configuration, init requests a ROM session for the ROM module "init" from
its parent, which is core. Figure [img/nested_config] shows an example of
such a config ROM module.

[tikz img/config_virtualization]
  Successive interception of "config" ROM requests

The config ROM module uses XML as syntax, which supports the expression of
arbitrary structural data while being simple to parse. I.e., Genode's XML
parser comes in the form of single header file with less than 400 lines of
code. Init's configuration is contained within a single '<config>' node.

Each component started by init obtains its configuration by requesting
a ROM module named "config" from its parent, which is init. Init responds to
this request by handling out a locally-provided ROM session. Instead of
handing out the "config" ROM module as obtained from core, it creates a new
dataspace that solely contains the portion of init's config ROM module that
refers to the respective child. Analogously to how init's configuration,
each child's configuration has the form of a single '<config>' node.
This works recursively. From each component's perspective, including the init
component, the mechanism for obtaining its configuration is identical -- it
obtains a ROM session for a ROM module named "config" from its parent.
The parent interposes the ROM session request as described in
Section [Interposing individual services]. Figure [img/config_virtualization]
shows the successive interposing of "config" ROM requests according to the
example configuration given in Figure [img/nested_config].
At each level, the information structure within the '<config>' node can
be different. Besides following the convention that a configuration has the
form of a single '<config>' node, each component can introduce arbitrary
custom tags and attributes.

Besides being simple, the use of the ROM session interface for supplying
configuration information has the benefit of supporting dynamic configuration
updates over the lifetime of the config ROM session. Section
[Read-only memory (ROM)] describes the update protocol between client
and server of a ROM session. This way, the configuration of long-living
components can be dynamically changed.


The init component
==================

The init component plays a special role within Genode's component tree. It
gets started directly by core, gets assigned all physical resources, and
controls the execution of all further component nodes, which can be further
instances of init. Init's policy is driven by an XML-based configuration,
which declares a number of children, their relationships, and resource
assignments.

; XXX specifically mention that init is meant to construct the static
;     part of the system, introduce the idea of organizing the system
;     in stages.


Session routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the parent-child interface, there are two operations that are subject to
policy decisions of the parent, the child announcing a service and the
child requesting a service. If a child announces a service, the parent is up
to decide if and how to make this service accessible to its other children.
When a child requests a service, the parent may deny the session request,
delegate the request to its own parent, implement the requested service
locally, or open a session at one of its other children. This decision may
depend on the requested service or the session-construction arguments provided
by the child. Apart from assigning resources to children, the central
element of the policy implemented in the parent is a set of rules to
route session requests. Therefore, init's configuration concept is laid out
around child components and the routing of session requests originating from
those components. The concept is best illustrated by an example:

! <config>
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="CAP"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="SIGNAL"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!   <start name="timer">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!     <provides> <service name="Timer"/> </provides>
!     <route>
!       <service name="CAP">    <parent/> </service>
!       <service name="SIGNAL"> <parent/> </service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!   <start name="test-timer">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!     <route>
!       <service name="Timer">  <child name="timer"/> </service>
!       <service name="LOG">    <parent/>             </service>
!       <service name="SIGNAL"> <parent/>             </service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
! </config>

First, there is the declaration of services provided by the parent of the
configured init instance. In this case, we declare that the parent provides a
CAP service, a LOG service, and a SIGNAL service.
For each child to start, there is a '<start>'
node describing resource assignments, declaring services provided by the child,
and holding a routing table for session requests originating from the child.
The first child is called "timer" and implements the "Timer" service. To
implement this service, the timer requires a CAP session. The routing table
defines that CAP session request are delegated to init's parent. The
second process called "test-timer" is a client of the timer service. In its
routing table, we see that requests for "Timer" sessions are routed to
the "timer" child whereas requests for "LOG" sessions are routed to
init's parent. Per-child service routing rules provide a flexible way to
express arbitrary client-server relationships. For example, service requests
may be transparently mediated through special policy components acting upon
session-construction arguments. There might be multiple children implementing
the same service, each targeted by different routing tables. If there is no
valid route to a requested service, the service is denied. In the example
above, the routing tables act effectively as a white list of services the child
is allowed to use.

In practice, usage scenarios become more complex than the basic example,
increasing the size of routing tables. Furthermore, in many practical cases,
multiple children may use the same set of services and require duplicated
routing tables within the configuration. In particular during development, the
elaborative specification of routing tables tend to become an inconvenience.
To alleviate this problem, there are two mechanisms, namely wildcards and a
default route.
Instead of specifying a list of individual service routes targeting the same
destination, the wildcard '<any-service>' becomes handy. For example, instead
of specifying
! <route>
!   <service name="ROM">    <parent/> </service>
!   <service name="RAM">    <parent/> </service>
!   <service name="RM">     <parent/> </service>
!   <service name="PD">     <parent/> </service>
!   <service name="CPU">    <parent/> </service>
!   <service name="SIGNAL"> <parent/> </service>
! </route>
the following shortcut can be used:
! <route>
!   <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
! </route>
The latter version is not as strict as the first one because it permits the
child to create sessions at the parent, which were not white listed in the
elaborative version. Therefore, the use of wildcards is discouraged for
configuring untrusted components. Wildcards and explicit routes may be combined
as illustrated by the following example:
! <route>
!   <service name="LOG"> <child name="nitlog"/> </service>
!   <any-service>        <parent/>              </any-service>
! </route>
The routing table is processed starting with the first entry. If the route
matches the service request, it is taken, otherwise the remaining
routing-table entries are visited. This way, the explicit service route of
"LOG" sessions to the "nitlog" child shadows the LOG service provided by the
parent.

To allow a child to use services provided by arbitrary other children, there
is a further wildcard called '<any-child>'. Using this wildcard, such a policy
can be expressed as follows:
! <route>
!   <any-service> <parent/>    </any-service>
!   <any-service> <any-child/> </any-service>
! </route>
This rule would delegate all session requests referring to one of the parent's
services to the parent. If no parent service matches the session request, the
request is routed to any child providing the service. The rule can be further
abbreviated to:
! <route>
!   <any-service> <parent/> <any-child/> </any-service>
! </route>
Init detects potential ambiguities caused by multiple children providing the
same service. In this case, the ambiguity must be resolved using an explicit
route preceding the wildcards.

To reduce the need to specify the same routing table for many children
in one configuration, there is a '<default-route>' mechanism. The default
route is declared within the '<config>' node and used for each '<start>'
entry with no '<route>' node. In particular during development, the default
route becomes handy to keep the configuration tidy and neat.

The combination of explicit routes and wildcards is designed to scale well from
being convenient to use during development towards being highly secure at
deployment time. If only explicit rules are present in the configuration, the
permitted relationships between all processes are explicitly defined and can be
easily verified. Note however that the degree those rules are enforced at the
kernel-interface level depends on the used base platform.


Resource quota saturation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a specified resource (i.e., RAM quota) exceeds the available resources.
The available resources are assigned completely to the child. This makes
it possible to assign all remaining resources to the last child by
simply specifying an overly large quantum.


Handing out slack resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resources may remain unused after the creation of all children if the
quantum of available resources is higher than sum of the quotas assigned to
the children.
Init makes such slack memory available to its children via the
resource-request protocol described in Section [Dynamic resource balancing].
Slack memory is handed out on a first-come first-served basis.


Multiple instantiation of a single ELF binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each '<start>' node requires a unique 'name' attribute. By default, the
value of this attribute is used as ROM module name for obtaining the ELF
binary from the parent. If multiple instances of a component with the same
ELF binary are needed, the binary name can be explicitly specified
using a '<binary>' sub node of the '<start>' node:
! <binary name="filename"/>
This way, a unique child name can be defined independently from the
binary name.


Nested configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

; XXX Figure showing an illustration of the nested scenario

Each '<start>' node can host a '<config>' sub node.
As described in Section [Nested configuration concept], the content of this
sub node is provided to the child when a ROM session for the file name
"config" is requested.
Thereby, arbitrary configuration parameters can be passed to the
child. For example, the following configuration starts 'timer-test' within an
init instance within another init instance. To show the flexibility of init's
service routing facility, the "Timer" session of the second-level 'timer-test'
child is routed to the timer service started at the first-level init instance.
! <config>
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="CAP"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!     <service name="RAM"/>
!     <service name="CPU"/>
!     <service name="RM"/>
!     <service name="PD"/>
!     <service name="SIGNAL"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!   <start name="timer">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!     <provides><service name="Timer"/></provides>
!     <route>
!       <any-service"> <parent/> </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!   <start name="init">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!     <config>
!       <parent-provides>
!         <service name="Timer"/>
!         <service name="LOG"/>
!         <service name="SIGNAL"/>
!       </parent-provides>
!       <start name="test-timer">
!         <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!         <route>
!           <any-service"> <parent/> </any-service>
!         </route>
!       </start>
!     </config>
!     <route>
!       <service name="Timer"> <child name="timer"/> </service>
!       <any-service">         <parent/>             </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
! </config>
The services ROM, RAM, CPU, RM, and PD are required by the second-level
init instance to create the timer-test component.
As illustrated by this example, the use of nested configurations
enables the construction of arbitrarily complex component trees via a single
configuration.

Alternatively to specifying all nested configurations in a single
configuration, sub configurations can be placed in a separate ROM modules
specified via the 'configfile' node. For example:
! <start name="nitpicker">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!   <configfile name="nitpicker.config"/>
! </start>


Assigning subsystems to CPUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most multi-processor (MP)systems have topologies that can be represented on a
two-dimensional coordinate system. CPU nodes
close to each other are expected to have closer relationship than distant
nodes. In a large MP system, it is natural to assign clusters of closely
related nodes to a given workload. As described in Section
[Recursive system structure] Genode's architecture is based on a strictly
hierarchic organizational structure. Thereby, it lends itself to the idea to
apply this successive virtualization of resources to the problem of clustering
CPU nodes.

[tikz img/affinity_spaces]
  Successive virtualization of CPU affinity spaces by nested instances
  of init

Each component within the component tree has a component-local view on a
so-called affinity space, which is a two-dimensional coordinate space. If the
component creates a new subsystem, it can assign a portion of its own affinity
space to the new subsystem by imposing a rectangular affinity location to the
subsystem's CPU session. Figure [img/affinity_spaces] illustrates the idea.

Following from the expression of affinities as a rectangular location within a
component-local affinity space, the assignment of subsystems to CPU nodes
consists of two parts, the definition of the affinity space dimensions as used
for the init instance, and the association sub systems with affinity locations
(relative to the affinity space).
The affinity space is configured as a sub node of the config node. For
example, the following declaration describes an affinity space of 4x2:

! <config>
!   ...
!   <affinity-space width="4" height="2" />
!   ...
! </config>

Subsystems can be constrained to parts of the affinity space using the
'<affinity>' sub node of a '<start>' entry:

! <config>
!   ...
!   <start name="loader">
!     <affinity xpos="0" ypos="1" width="2" height="1" />
!     ...
!   </start>
!   ...
! </config>

As illustrated by this example, the numbers used in the declarations for this
instance of init are not directly related to physical CPUs.
If the machine has merely two cores, init's affinity space would be mapped to
the range 0,1 of physical CPUs. However, in a machine with 16x16 CPUs, the
loader would obtain 8x8 CPUs with the upper-left CPU at position (4,0).


Priority support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of CPU priorities to be distinguished by init can be specified with
the 'prio_levels' attribute of the '<config>' node. The value must be a power of
two. By default, no priorities are used. To assign a priority to a child
process, a priority value can be specified as 'priority' attribute of the
corresponding '<start>' node. Valid priority values lie in the range of
-prio_levels + 1 (maximum priority degradation) to 0 (no priority degradation).


Init verbosity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ease the debugging, init can be instructed to print various status
information as LOG output. To enable the verbose mode, assign the value "yes"
to the 'verbose' attribute of the '<config>' node.


Executing children in chroot environments on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Linux base platform, each process started by init can be assigned to
a chroot environment by specifying the new root location as 'root' attribute
to the corresponding '<start>' node. Root environments can be nested. The
root path of a nested init instance will be appended to the root path of
the outer instance.

When using the chroot mechanism, core will mirror the current working
directory within the chroot environment via the bind mount operation. This
step is needed to enable execve to obtain the ELF binary of the new process.

In order to use the chroot mechanism when starting Genode's core as a non-root
user process, the core executable must be equipped with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and
CAP_SYS_CHROOT capabilities. CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed for bind mounting.
CAP_SYS_CHROOT is needed to perform the 'chroot' syscall:

! sudo setcap cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_chroot=ep core

For an example of using chroot, please refer to the _os/run/chroot.run_ script.


; XXX where to put this information?
;
; Using the configuration concept
; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
; 
; To get acquainted with the configuration format, there are two example
; configuration files located at 'os/src/init/', which are both ready-to-use with
; the Linux version of Genode. Both configurations produce the same scenario but
; they differ in the way policy is expressed. The 'explicit_routing'
; configuration is an example for the elaborative specification of all service
; routes. All service requests not explicitly specified are denied. So this
; policy is a whitelist enforcing mandatory access control on each session
; request. The example illustrates well that such a elaborative specification is
; possible in an intuitive manner. However, it is pretty comprehensive. In cases
; where the elaborative specification of service routing is not fundamentally
; important, in particular during development, the use of wildcards can help to
; simplify the configuration. The 'wildcard' example demonstrates the use of a
; default route for session-request resolution and wildcards. This variant is
; less strict about which child uses which service. For development, its
; simplicity is beneficial but for deployment, we recommend to remove wildcards
; ('<default-route>', '<any-child>', and '<any-service>') altogether.  The
; absence of such wildcards is easy to check automatically to ensure that service
; routes are explicitly whitelisted.
; 
; Further configuration examples can be found in the 'os/config/' directory.
