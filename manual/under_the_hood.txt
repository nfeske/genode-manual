IOMMU support
=============

As discussed in Section [Direct memory access (DMA) transactions], misbehaving
device driver may exploit DMA transactions to circumvent their component
boundary. When executing Genode on the NOVA microhypervisor, however,
bus-master DMA is subjected to the IOMMU.

NOVAs interface to the IOMMU is quite elegant. The kernel simply
applies a subset of the (MMU) address space of a process (aka protection domain
in NOVA speak) to the (IOMMU) address space of a device. So the device's
address space can be managed in the same way as we normally manage the address
space of a process. The only missing link is the assignment of device address
spaces to process address spaces. This link is provided by the dedicated system
call "assign_pci" that takes a process identifier and a device identifier as
arguments. Of course, both arguments must be subjected to a security policy.
Otherwise, any process could assign any device to any other process. To enforce
security, the process identifier is a capability to the respective protection
domain and the device identifier is a virtual address where the extended PCI
configuration space of the device is mapped in the specified protection domain.
Only if a user-level device driver got access to the extended PCI configuration
space of the device, it is able to get the assignment in place.

To make NOVA's IOMMU support available to Genode components,
the ACPI driver has the ability to hand out the extended PCI configuration
space of a device, and a NOVA-specific extension ('assign_pci') to the PD session
interface can be used to associate a PCI device with a protection domain.

;   NOVAs management of the IOMMU address spaces facilities the use of
;   driver-local virtual addresses as DMA addresses.

Even though these mechanisms combined principally
suffice to let drivers operate with the IOMMU enabled, in practice, the
situation is a bit more complicated. Because NOVA uses the same
virtual-to-physical mappings for the device as it uses for the process, the DMA
addresses the driver needs to supply to the device must be virtual addresses
rather than physical addresses. Consequently, to be able to make a device
driver usable on systems without IOMMU as well as on systems with IOMMU, the
driver needs to be IOMMU-aware and distinguish both cases. This is an
unfortunate consequence of the otherwise elegant mechanism provided by NOVA. To
relieve the device drivers from caring about both cases, Genode decouples
the virtual address space of the device from the virtual address space of the
driver. The former address space is represented by a Genode process called
_device PD_. Its sole purpose
is to hold mappings of DMA buffers that are accessible by the associated
device. By using one-to-one physical-to-virtual mappings for those buffers
within the device PD, each device PD contains a subset of the physical address
space. The ACPI driver performs the assignment of device PDs to PCI
devices. If a device driver intends to use DMA, it allocates a new DMA buffer
for a specific PCI device at the ACPI driver.
The ACPI driver responds to such a request by allocating a RAM dataspace at core,
attaching it to the device PD using the dataspace's physical address as virtual
address, and handing out the dataspace capability to the client. If the driver
requests the physical address of the dataspace, the returned address will be a
valid virtual address in the associated device PD.
From this design follows that a device driver must allocate DMA buffers at the
ACPI server (specifying the PCI device the buffer is intended for) instead of
using core's RAM service to allocate buffers anonymously. Note that the
current implementation of the ACPI server assigns all PCI devices to only one
device PD.
