Operating-system framework
==========================

The Genode OS framework is a tool kit for building highly secure
special-purpose operating systems. It scales from embedded systems with as
little as 4 MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.

Genode is based on a recursive system structure. Each program runs in a
dedicated sandbox and gets granted only those access rights and resources that
are needed for its specific purpose. Programs can create and manage
sub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where
policies can be applied at each level. The framework provides mechanisms to
let programs communicate with each other and trade their resources, but only
in strictly-defined manners. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface
of security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared
to contemporary operating systems.

The framework aligns the construction principles of L4 microkernels with Unix
philosophy.
In line with Unix philosophy, Genode is a collection of small building blocks,
out of which sophisticated systems can be composed. But unlike Unix, those
building blocks include not only applications but also all classical OS
functionalities including kernels, device drivers, file systems, and protocol
stacks.

:CPU architectures:

  Genode supports the x86 (32 and 64 bit) and ARM CPU architectures.
  On x86, modern architectural features such as IOMMUs and
  hardware virtualization can be utilized.
  On ARM, Genode is able to use TrustZone technology.

:Kernels:

  Genode can be deployed on a variety of different kernels including
  most members of the L4 family (NOVA, Fiasco.OC, OKL4 v2.1, L4ka::Pistachio,
  Codezero, L4/Fiasco).
  Furthermore, it can be used on top of the Linux kernel to attain
  rapid development-test cycles during development.
  Additionally, Genode comes with custom kernel for ARM-based platforms
  that was specifically developed for Genode and thereby
  further reduces the complexity of the trusted computing base
  compared to other kernels.

:Virtualization:

  Genode support virtualization at different levels:
  * On NOVA, faithful virtualization via VirtualBox allows the execution of
    unmodified guest operating systems as Genode subsystems. Alternatively,
    the Seoul virtual machine monitor can be used to run unmodified
    Linux-based guest OSes..
  * On the Fiasco.OC kernel, L4Linux represents a paravirtualized Linux
    kernel that allows the use of regular Linux distributions as well as
    Android.
  * With Noux, there exists a custom runtime environment for Unix
    software such as GNU coreutils, bash, GCC, binutils, and findutils.
  * On ARM, Genode can be used as TrustZone monitor.

:Building blocks:

  There exist more than 100 ready-to-use components such as
  * Device drivers for most common PC peripherals including networking,
    storage, display, USB, PS/2, Intel wireless, and audio output,
  * Device drivers for a variety of ARM-based SoCs such as Texas Instruments
    OMAP4,
    Samsung Exynos5, and FreeScale i.MX,
  * A GUI stack including a low-complexity GUI server, window management,
    and widget toolkits such as Qt5.


Licensing and commercial support
================================

Genode is commercially supported by the German company Genode Labs GmbH, which
offers trainings, development work under contract, developer support, and
commercial licensing:

The framework is available under two flavours of licences, an open-source
license and commercial licensing.
The primary license used for the distribution of the Genode OS framework is
the GNU General Public License Version 2 (GNU GPL). In short, the GNU GPL
grants everybody the rights to

* Use the Genode OS framework without paying any license fee
* Freely distribute the software
* Modify the source code and distribute modified versions of the software

In turn, the GNU GPL requires any modifications and derived work to be
published under the same or a GPL-compatible license.

For applications that require more permissive licensing conditions than
granted by the GNU GPL, Genode Labs offers commercial licensing options upon
request. Please write to _info@genode-labs.com_.
