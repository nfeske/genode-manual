Sticking together a little Unix
===============================

_This section is based on Norman Feske's_
_[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2019-12-13-goa-unix-bash - article series]_
_at [https://genodians.org]_.

This tutorial takes you on a ride of creating a small Unix OS out of Genode's
ready-to-use building blocks, publishing the result, and deploying it on
top of Sculpt OS. It shows the fun and productive way of crafting component
compositions out of Genode's readily available building blocks. What could be a
better example than building an old-school operating system - Unix - that we all
know and love? You can find the results of this tutorial in Norman's playground
repository.

Preparations
------------

Before continuing, please make sure to have installed the Goa tool, which
is available at [https://github.com/genodelabs/goa]. If you have it installed
already, please make sure the tool is up to date. You can issue the following
command to update Goa to the latest version:

! $ goa update-goa


Hello bash
----------

As the first step, we want to get a life sign of the bash shell.
We start with a new Goa project appropriately named 'unix' that hosts
a runtime package but no source code.

! $ mkdir unix
! $ cd unix
! unix$ mkdir -p pkg/unix

Let's pretend we don't know what we are doing and create an _archives_
file with only bash listed, and an almost empty _runtime_ file. The runtime
starts the binary 'init', which is supposed to be a ROM module. Please have
a look at 'goa help runtime' for more details on how to write runtime files.

The _pkg/unix/archives_ file:
! genodelabs/src/bash

The _pkg/unix/runtime_ file:
! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init">
!   <content>
!     <rom label="init"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

Let's see what happens when issuing the 'run' command:

! unix$ goa run

! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/bash/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/bash/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/src/bash/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/src/bash/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/libc/2023-10-03.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/libc/2023-10-03.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/noux/2023-06-15.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/noux/2023-06-15.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/posix/2020-05-17.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/posix/2020-05-17.tar.xz.sig
! [unix] Error: runtime lacks a configuration
!
!  You may declare a 'config' attribute in the <runtime> node, or 
!  define a <config> node inside the <runtime> node.

Let's follow the advice by adding an empty '<config>' node to our
_pkg/unix/runtime_ file:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init">
!   <config/>
!   <content>
!     <rom label="init"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

Besides the error message, you could see that Goa automatically downloaded bash
along with its dependencies such as the libc.
Besides the binaries, it also fetches all source codes. You can find all the
downloads at _var/depot/_. One particularly interesting directory is the
binary archive for bash:

! unix$ ls var/depot/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/bash/2023-10-24/
!
! bash.tar

It contains a single tar archive, which in turn, contains all installation
files of bash. Let's take a look inside:

! unix$ tar tf var/depot/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/bash/2023-10-24/bash.tar

! ./
! ./share
! ./share/doc
! ...
! ./bin/bashbug
! ./bin/bash

Of course, the most interesting bit is the 'bash' executable at _bin/bash_.
When using the binary archive, the whole _bash.tar_ is supplemented to
Genode as a single ROM module. Let's add it to the <content> of the
_pkg/unix/runtime_:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init">
!   <config/>
!   <content>
!     <rom label="init"/>
!     <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

After issuing 'goa run' again, Goa downloads the additional packages
needed to run our _pkg/unix_ on Linux, integrates the scenario, and starts it.

! unix$ goa run
! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2023-10-24.tar.xz

! Genode sculpt-23.10
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init

You can find _bash.tar_ added to the _var/run/_ directory, which comprises all
the ROM modules of our Genode system.

Of course, we cannot start a TAR archive. It is not an executable after
all. We rather need to access the content of the archive. Here, the
combination of three Genode components namely VFS, 'fs_rom', and init
come to the rescue.

# The VFS server is able to mount a TAR archive locally as a virtual file
  system and offer its content as a _file-system service_.

# The 'fs_rom' component provides a ROM service by fetching the content
  of ROM modules from a file system. By connecting the 'fs_rom' with the VFS
  component, the files of the _bash.tar_ archives become available as ROM
  modules. With the bash executable binary accessible, we can execute it.

# The init component allows us to stick components together and let the
  result appear to the surrounding system as a single component. We can
  use it to host the composition of the VFS, 'fs_rom', and bash.

Note that our _pkg/unix/runtime_ refers to Genode's init component
in the attribute 'binary="init"'. So as a whole, our subsystem will be an
instance of init. Internally, init will host several child components
and manage their resources and relationships according to its configuration.
Let's start with a fresh init that hosts only the VFS server by
replacing our empty <config/> in our _pkg/unix/runtime_ file by the
following configuration.

! <config>
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="RM"/>
!     <service name="CPU"/>
!     <service name="PD"/>
!     <service name="Timer"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!
!   <start name="vfs" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
!     <config>
!       <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
!       <default-policy root="/" />
!     </config>
!     <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
!   </start>
!
! </config>

The <default-policy> expresses that any client should be able to access
the root of the virtual file system in a read-only fashion.

When trying to 'run' the scenario now, you see a bunch of messages:

! unix$ goa run
!
! [unix] config <parent-provides> mentions a timer service;
!        consider adding <timer/> as a required runtime service
! Genode sculpt-23.10
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> unix] Error: vfs: environment ROM session denied ...

The first message points out that init's '<parent-provides>' declaration
refers to a service that should better also be announced as a requirement in the
_runtime_ file. This can be done by adding the following '<requires>' node
inside the '<runtime>' node.

! <runtime>
!   ...
!   <requires>
!     <timer/>
!   </requires>
!   ...
! </runtime>

The subsequent "Error:" messages tell us that init requested the ROM module
'vfs' that is not available to the scenario, yet.
To make this ingredient available to our scenario, we have to
declare it in the _archives_ and as <content> in the _runtime_ file.
While we are at it, lets also capture the need for 'init' because our entire
scenario is based on this component.
Let's add the following lines to _pkg/unix/archive_:

! genodelabs/src/vfs
! genodelabs/src/init

Also make sure to have the ROM modules listed as <content> in the
_pkg/unix/runtime_ so that it looks as follows:

! <content>
!   <rom label="init"/>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
! </content>

When issuing 'goa run' again, we can see Goa downloading the additional
components. On the attempt to start the scenario, we are confronted with
another error message:

! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: Could not open ROM session for "vfs.lib.so"

This message tells us that the VFS server requests another ROM module, which
is a shared library. The _vfs.lib.so_ contains the actual implementation
of the virtual file system. It comes in the form of a library to enable its
use either locally by an individual application or via the VFS server. The
library is part of the 'genodelabs/src/vfs' archive that is already listed in our
_archives_ file. So we can resolve this error by adding a corresponding <rom>
entry to the _runtime_ file. The <content> should now look as follows:

! <content>
!   <rom label="init"/>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
!   <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
! </content>

When running the scenario again, we see a sign of hope:

! unix$ goa run

! Genode sculpt-23.10
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init

No further errors! That means that the VFS server is running and has
presumably mounted the _bash.tar_ archive. On a second terminal, you can
indeed observe the VFS server showing up.

$ ps u
! ... [Genode] init
! ... [Genode] init -> timer
! ... [Genode] init -> unix
! ... [Genode] init -> unix -> vfs

The second piece of the puzzle is the 'fs_rom' server, which can be added
to the <config> node of _pkg/unix/runtime_ with the following snippet:

! <start name="vfs_rom" caps="100">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!   <binary name="fs_rom"/>
!   <provides> <service name="ROM"/> </provides>
!   <config/>
!   <route>
!     <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

By using the <binary> node, we can label the component in a meaningful
way, calling it "vfs_rom". The first entry of the <route> node defines that
the request for a file-system session should be routed to the "vfs" component.

On the next attempt to issue 'goa run', we face an error message:

! [init -> unix] Error: vfs_rom: environment ROM session denied

By now, I'm sure you know how to resolve this one. Corresponding entries
to your _archives_ file and the _runtime_ file's <content> are added swiftly.
The fs_rom component gives us no life sign, which is normal. If you want to
get a little bit more action on screen, you may add the 'verbose="yes"'
attribute to init's <config> node. Another try of 'goa run' reveals the
following output.

! unix$ goa run
!
! Genode sculpt-23.10
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> unix] parent provides
! [init -> unix]   service "ROM"
! [init -> unix]   service "LOG"
! [init -> unix]   service "RM"
! [init -> unix]   service "CPU"
! [init -> unix]   service "PD"
! [init -> unix]   service "Timer"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs"
! [init -> unix]   RAM quota:  9992K
! [init -> unix]   cap quota:  66
! [init -> unix]   ELF binary: vfs
! [init -> unix]   priority:   0
! [init -> unix]   provides service File_system
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom"
! [init -> unix]   RAM quota:  9992K
! [init -> unix]   cap quota:  66
! [init -> unix]   ELF binary: fs_rom
! [init -> unix]   priority:   0
! [init -> unix]   provides service ROM
! [init -> unix] child "vfs" announces service "File_system"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom" announces service "ROM"

That looks promising. Now with the bash executable available as ROM module,
let's give the bash shell a spin:

! <start name="/bin/bash" caps="1000">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!   <config>
!     <libc stdin="/dev/null" stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"
!           rtc="/dev/null"/>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
!     </vfs>
!     <arg value="bash"/>
!     <arg value="-c"/>
!     <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/*"/>
!   </config>
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!       <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

The following parts are worth highlighting:

* The bash has its own VFS! This has nothing to do with the VFS server
  we started above. In fact, bash's VFS - as configured by the <vfs>
  node - merely contains the two pseudo files _/dev/null_ and _/dev/log_.
  The latter one is a LOG connection that enables the bash to write
  messages to the outside world.

* The <libc> node contains the configuration of the C runtime used by bash.
  Here we say how the standard output should go, or that the C runtime
  should obtain its "real-time-clock" information from _/dev/null_. No
  time for you this time!

* Via the sequence of <arg> nodes, we execute the command
  ! echo files at /dev: /dev/*
  It uses the shell's file globbing mechanism to obtain the list of files
  matching the pattern "/dev/*" and prints it via the 'echo' built-in command.

* The <route> rules explicitly tell init that the binary of the component
  should be obtained from the "vfs_rom" component.

When trying to 'goa run' the scenario now, we have to add a few more entries
to our _archives_ and <content>, specifically because bash uses the C runtime
(libc and libm) as well as the posix library. The full list of _archives_
now looks as follows:

! genodelabs/src/bash
! genodelabs/src/vfs
! genodelabs/src/init
! genodelabs/src/fs_rom
! genodelabs/src/libc
! genodelabs/src/posix

For reference, the <rom> modules listed in the _runtime_ file's <content>
node:

! <content>
!   <rom label="init"/>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
!   <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="fs_rom"/>
!   <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
! </content>

Once these stumbling blocks are out of the way, 'goa run' greets us with the
following output:

! ...
! [init -> unix] child "vfs" announces service "File_system"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom" announces service "ROM"
! [init -> unix -> /bin/bash] files at /dev: /dev/log /dev/null
! [init -> unix] child "/bin/bash" exited with exit value 0

The message "files at /dev: /dev/log /dev/null"
is the output of the bash command we have hoped for!


Some reorg is in order
----------------------

The scenario we just built was quite small. For such small
scenarios, defining the <config> node right in the _runtime_ file is quite
handy. Once the subsystem becomes bigger, however, its better to move
the <config> into a dedicated ROM module. Let us create a new directory
named _raw/_ inside the project directory, and move the <config> node from
the _runtime_ file to a new file _raw/unix.config_. Goa will pick up all files
contained in the _raw/_ directory and supply them as ROM modules to the Genode
scenario.

Since there is no longer a <config> provided in the _runtime_ file, we tell
the runtime to use the "unix.config" as configuration by changing the <runtime>
node as follows:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init" config="unix.config">

Since _unix.config_ is expected to be present as a ROM module, we have
to declare via a <rom> node in the _runtime_ file.

For reference, the _pkg/unix/runtime_ file should now look as follows:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init" config="unix.config">
!
!   <content>
!     <rom label="init"/>
!     <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!     <rom label="vfs"/>
!     <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="fs_rom"/>
!     <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="unix.config"/>
!   </content>
!
! </runtime>

The _raw/unix.config_ file:

! <config verbose="yes">
!
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="RM"/>
!     <service name="CPU"/>
!     <service name="PD"/>
!     <service name="Timer"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!
!   <start name="vfs" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
!     <config>
!       <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
!       <default-policy root="/" />
!     </config>
!     <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
!   </start>
!
!   <start name="vfs_rom" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <binary name="fs_rom"/>
!     <provides> <service name="ROM"/> </provides>
!     <config/>
!     <route>
!       <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!       <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!
!   <start name="/bin/bash" caps="1000">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!     <config>
!       <libc stdin="/dev/null" stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"
!             rtc="/dev/null"/>
!       <vfs>
!         <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
!       </vfs>
!       <arg value="bash"/>
!       <arg value="-c"/>
!       <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/*"/>
!     </config>
!     <route>
!       <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!         <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!       <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!
! </config>

This reorganization has two advantages. First, we save one indentation
level for the <config> node. Second, by separating the _unix.config_ from
the _runtime_ in the form of a dedicated ROM module, we can later reuse
the same ROM module for other _runtime_ files. It is always good to have
reusable building blocks.

You may give the new version a try by issuing 'goa run'. The output should
look familiar.


GUI stack
---------

Goa supports interactive system scenarios by looking at the requirements
stated in the _runtime_ file. Right now, the runtime file merely states
the amount of RAM and caps as a requirement. We can add the presence of
a GUI service as an additional requirement by adding a <gui> node
inside the <runtime> node:

! <requires>
!   <gui/>
!   <timer/>
! </requires>

When Goa processes the 'goa run' command, it evaluates this information.
The <gui> node tells Goa that the scenario will request a
session to a GUI server. When running the scenario on Linux,
Goa will automatically integrate the components needed for such a GUI server.
This includes a pseudo graphics driver, a pseudo input driver, and the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/os/src/server/nitpicker - nitpicker GUI server].

Let's try 'goa run' after having added the <requires> definition to our
_runtime_. Goa responds with the following message:

! [unix] Error: runtime requires <gui/>,
!               which is not mentioned in <parent-provides>

It points out the fact that the runtime file pretends to require a <gui>
service but according to init configuration in _unix.config_ no such
service is actually obtained from the parent. So either the <requires>
definition is superfluous or the init configuration is wrong or incomplete.
To satisfy this sanity check, let's add the following line to the
<parent-provides> declarations in the _raw/unix.config_ file.

! <parent-provides>
!   ...
!   <service name="Gui"/>
! </parent-provides>

Upon the next 'goa run', we can see that Goa automatically downloads the
basic components of the GUI stack. Not only that. When starting the scenario,
a new window with a greenish background pops up. When hovering the mouse over the window,
you can see a small mouse pointer. If you are curious how the
GUI stack is assembled in detail, please have a look at _var/run/config_.
Yet, from the perspective of our Unix scenario, these exact details are not
of interest. The only important point is that our scenario is now officially
able to request a "Gui" and a "Timer" service from the underlying
system.

With these preconditions in place, we can start a graphical terminal
in our _unix.config_ by adding the following <start> node:

! <start name="terminal" caps="110">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!   <provides> <service name="Terminal"/> </provides>
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label="config">
!       <parent label="terminal.config"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

The
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/gems/src/server/terminal - "terminal"]
uses a GUI service to create a graphical terminal and provides the textual
input and output in the form of a "Terminal" service. In the routing rules of
the terminal, you can see that the terminal's configuration is fetched from a
dedicated ROM module called "terminal.config". We have no such ROM module
defined yet. However, let's still give it a try:

! [init -> unix] Error: terminal: environment ROM session denied (label="terminal" ...)
! ...

That's not surprising as we have not added 'terminal' to our
_archives_ nor have we stated the <rom> modules in the runtime file's <content>.
Let's do this now. While we are at it, let's also add a <rom> node for the
"terminal.config" ROM.

The following line must be added to _pkg/unix/archives_

! genodelabs/src/terminal

The following two lines must be added to the runtime file's <content>:

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="terminal"/>
!   <rom label="terminal.config"/>
! </content>

When trying 'goa run' again, we see that we exchanged the previous errors
with a new one. Let's call it progress:

! [unix] Error: Unable to find content ROM module 'terminal.config'.

!  You either need to add it to the 'raw/' directory 
!  or add the corresponding dependency to the 'archives' file.

The error is easy to explain. We have configured the "terminal"
start node to fetch its configuration from a ROM called _terminal.config_
but have not defined the ROM module so far. Let's add a new file
_raw/terminal.config_ with an empty <config> node:

! <config/>

With the file added, our next call of 'goa run' is answered as follows.

! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: Uncaught exception of type
!                            'Genode::Xml_node::Nonexistent_sub_node'
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Warning: abort called - thread: ep

Well, the terminal seems underwhelmed by us serving an empty <config/> as
configuration. It is time to become more specific. Let's change the
content of the _raw/terminal.config_ to something meaningful:

! <config>
!   <vfs>
!     <rom name="VeraMono.ttf"/>
!     <dir name="fonts">
!       <dir name="monospace">
!         <ttf name="regular" path="/VeraMono.ttf" size_px="16"/>
!       </dir>
!     </dir>
!   </vfs>
! </config>

Wait a minute. How is this a terminal configuration?

The terminal expects its font to be found at its local VFS at
_/fonts/monospace_. The font has the form of a pseudo file system that
provides the pixel data of the glyphs along with the font meta data as a bunch
of pseudo files. So here, we mount a TrueType font with the 'ttf' file-system
driver at _/fonts/monospace_. The font file is specified as 'path' attribute,
which refers to "/VeraMono.ttf". This file, in turn, is backed by a <rom>
session that requests the ROM module named "VeraMono.ttf".

With this configuration in place, the next attempt of 'goa run' yields a
quite predictable result:

! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: could not open ROM session for "VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: failed to create <rom> VFS node
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     name="VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: ROM-session creation failed (...)
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: could not open ROM session for "vfs_ttf.lib.so"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: failed to create <ttf> VFS node
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     name="regular"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     path="/VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     size_px="16"

The terminal configuration refers to two ROM modules that we haven't yet
included into the scenario. The "VeraMono.ttf" is the TrueType font data we
tried to mount as <rom> node. The "vfs_ttf.lib.so" is the driver for the "ttf"
pseudo file system. It is requested by the VFS when the <ttf> is encountered.
The errors can be resolved by extending the _archives_ file and the _runtime_
file's <content> node accordingly.

The following lines must be added to _pkg/unix/archives_

! genodelabs/raw/ttf-bitstream-vera-minimal
! genodelabs/src/vfs_ttf

The following lines must be added to the <content> node in _pkg/unix/runtime_

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="VeraMono.ttf"/>
!   <rom label="vfs_ttf.lib.so"/>
! </content>

Good news! On the next try of 'goa run', you can see the error gone and are
greeted with a black screen instead.
The log output of '/bin/bash' looks as usual.


Connecting bash with the terminal
---------------------------------

With the current scenario, bash and the GUI stack are running peacefully
side by side but they do not interact with each other. To connect them,
we do the following:

# Mount a terminal session to the VFS of the VFS server at /dev/terminal.

  This can be done by changing the content of the <start> node of the
  VFS server. As a reminder, this is how it looks so far:

  ! <config>
  !   <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
  !   <default-policy root="/" />
  ! </config>
  ! <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>

  We change it to the following:

  ! <config>
  !   <vfs>
  !     <tar name="bash.tar"/>
  !     <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
  !   </vfs>
  !   <default-policy root="/" />
  !   <policy label_prefix="/bin/bash" root="/" writeable="yes" />
  ! </config>
  ! <route>
  !   <service name="Terminal"> <child name="terminal"/> </service>
  !   <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
  ! </route>

  The <vfs> node gained the configuration of _/dev/terminal_. When the
  VFS encounters the <terminal> node upon initialization, it will request
  a session to a "Terminal" service.
  The added route tells init to route the terminal session
  towards the "terminal" component.
  The added <policy> node defines that a file-system client labeled as
  "/bin/bash" is allowed to access the entirety of the VFS in a writeable
  fashion.

# Mount the file system as provided by the VFS server into the VFS of the
  bash shell. This way, all files provided by the VFS server become
  visible in the file name space of bash. This can be done by extending
  the <vfs> of bash by adding an <fs/> node:

  ! <vfs>
  !   <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
  !   <fs/>
  ! </vfs>

  When the VFS of bash encounters the <fs/> node, it will request a session
  to a "File_system" service. To let this request reach the VFS server,
  we have to add a new entry to the <route> definition.

  ! <route>
  !   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
  !   ...
  ! </route>

To have a visible effect, let's redirect the output of the "echo" command
executed by bash to the pseudo file _/dev/terminal_. Change the bash
argument to the following (just appending the "> /dev/terminal"):

! <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/* > /dev/terminal"/>

Upon the next attempt of 'goa run', magic happens:

[image goa_bash_terminal]

We have just redirected the output of the bash command to our terminal, which
used our TrueType pseudo-file-system driver to render glyphs on a pixel buffer
that, in turn, was blitted by the nitpicker GUI server to screen. Could our
day become any better? Sure! How about interacting with bash directly?

Change the <libc> configuration of bash to the following:

! <libc stdin="/dev/terminal" stdout="/dev/terminal" stderr="/dev/terminal"
!       rtc="/dev/null"/>

This change wires up the standard input and output of bash with
_/dev/terminal_. Let's also drop the '-c' arguments from the bash <config> so
that bash will wait for a command typed in via stdin. The next 'goa run'
will greet us with a shell prompt where we can type in bash commands like
echo:

[image goa_bash_interactive 60%]

Of course, we feel a sudden urge to also execute the 'ls' command.

[image goa_ls_command_not_found 50%]

The 'ls' command is a separate Unix command that is not yet part of our
scenario. It is covered by the following section.


Adding GNU coreutils
--------------------

The 'ls' command - along with
most others we commonly associate with Unix - are actually little programs
that are spawned by the shell each time when used. When typing 'ls', bash
doesn't actually know the purpose of 'ls'. It merely looks up a program named
'ls' and executes it. The program 'ls', in turn, has the single purpose
of printing directory contents. When executed, it takes a look at the file
system, prints the gathered information, and exits. The 'ls' command together
with its friends 'cp', 'mkdir', 'sort', and many others are the Unix core
utilities. On a regular GNU/Linux system, they are provided by the
[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html - GNU coreutils]
package.

The GNU coreutils package is readily available for Genode. We can add it
by appending the following line to our _pkg/unix/archives_ file:

! genodelabs/src/coreutils

After adding this line, the next invocation of 'goa run' will download
the source code along with a ready-to-use binaries to _var/depot/_.
In particular, you can find the binary at
_var/depot/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/coreutils/<version>/_.
Analogous to the bash package, described in Section [Hello bash],
there is a single TAR archive containing all the files that comprise the
coreutils installation.

! unix$ tar tf var/depot/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/coreutils/2023-10-24/coreutils.tar
! ./
! ./lib/
! ...
! ./share/
! ...
! ./bin/
! ./bin/uname
! ./bin/groups
! ./bin/dircolors
! ./bin/chcon
! ./bin/nproc
! ./bin/true
! ./bin/mv
! ...

We follow the same pattern as previously used for integrating the _bash.tar_
archive.

# Declaring the use of 'coreutils.tar' as ROM module in the _pkg/unix/runtime_
  file's <content> node:

  ! <content>
  !   ...
  !   <rom label="coreutils.tar"/>
  ! </content>

# Mounting the 'coreutils.tar' as file system into the VFS of the VFS server.
  The VFS server's <vfs> should now look as follows:

  ! <vfs>
  !   <tar name="bash.tar"/>
  !   <tar name="coreutils.tar"/>
  !   <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
  ! </vfs>

  As you can see, the VFS supports the mounting any number of file systems
  side by side as overlays, which is commonly known as
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_mount - union mounting].

Remember from the end of the previous section that our attempt to issue
'ls' resulted in the following message:

[image goa_ls_command_not_found 50%]

Let's give 'goa run' another go now.

[image goa_ls_no_such_file 60%]

Unlike before, bash has actually found the 'ls' binary on the file system. We
mounted 'coreutils.tar' into the VFS after all, which you can easily reaffirm
via 'cd bin; echo *'. However, bash still failed to spawn the 'ls' program.
Genode's log output reveals why:

! [init -> ...] Error: Could not open ROM session for "/bin/ls"
! [init -> ...] Warning: execve: executable binary inaccessible as ROM module

Remember from Section [Hello bash]
that we have to make a program's binary available as ROM module in order to
execute it. We have accomplished this via the 'fs_rom' server handing out
file-system content as ROM modules, and directing bash's request for the
"/bin/bash" ROM module to 'fs_rom'. To recap, we defined the <route> rules for
'bash' as follows:

! <route>
!   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
! </route>

There is no valid route for a ROM service and the label "/bin/ls" yet.
In principle, we could follow the pattern of the "/bin/bash" ROM.
On the other hand, with many binaries installed at _/bin/_, the approach
would become cumbersome. A better solution is adding a route that matches
the label prefix "/bin". Changing the <route> of "/bin/bash" as follows
does the trick (pay attention to the third <service> node).

! <route>
!   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_prefix="/bin">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <any-service> <parent/> <any-child/> </any-service>
! </route>

In the following, we don't want to refer to the Unix commands using their
full paths but by their names. So let us set the 'PATH' environment variable
in the '<config>' of bash's '<start>' node.

! <config>
!   ..
!   <env key="PATH" value="/bin"/>
! </config>

The next try of 'goa run' yields the following result:

[image goa_ls_working 40%]

A look at _/bin/_ reveals the wealth of commands that have just become
available at our finger tips.

[image goa_ls_bin]


Plumbing pipes
--------------

Let us try to count'em via the 'wc -l' command ('wc -l' counts the number of
lines).

[image goa_pipe_error 70%]

With our attempt of using a pipe, feeding the output of 'ls -1' via the '|'
symbol as input into 'wc -l', we seem to hit another brick wall.
But that one isn't too bad. Until now, we haven't yet configured the
C runtime of "/bin/bash" (and its child processes) for the use of a pipe
mechanism. We can do so by adding a 'pipe' attribute to the <libc> node:

! <libc stdin="/dev/terminal" stdout="/dev/terminal" stderr="/dev/terminal"
!       rtc="/dev/null" pipe="/dev/pipe"/>

But _/dev/pipe_ does not exist, you ask! Thanks for paying attention.
On traditional Unix systems, the pipe mechanism is provided by the kernel.
On Genode, we provide it via a pseudo file system that is shared by both
ends of the pipe. The path _/dev/pipe/_ is the location of this pseudo
file system. To make it easily available to all Unix processes, we have
to mount it into the VFS of the VFS server. As a reminder, the <vfs> of the
VFS server currently looks as follows.

! <vfs>
!   <tar name="bash.tar"/>
!   <tar name="coreutils.tar"/>
!   <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
! </vfs>

With the addition of the pipe pseudo file system, we change the
'<dir name="dev">' node into this:

! <dir name="dev">
!   <terminal/>
!   <dir name="pipe"> <pipe/> </dir>
! </dir>

As usual after making such changes, the repeated use of 'goa run' guides us
forward:

! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: Could not open ROM session for "vfs_pipe.lib.so"
! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: failed to create <pipe> VFS node

I'm sure, you guess what comes next. Let's enhance _pkg/unix/archives_ with
the following line:

! genodelabs/src/vfs_pipe

Also declare the "vfs_pipe.lib.so" ROM in our _pkg/unix/runtime_ file:

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="vfs_pipe.lib.so"/>
! </content>

With these minor tweaks in place, 'goa run' starts up successfully again.
This time, our attempt to combine 'ls' with 'wc' works as intended!

[image goa_ls_wc 50%]


Life is not complete without Vim
--------------------------------

To wrap up the Unix experience, let's add the Vim text editor to the scenario.
The process is rather straight forward and follows exactly the pattern of the
addition of coreutils. That is

# Add vim to _pkg/unix/archives_

  ! genodelabs/src/vim

# Add the "vim.tar: ROM to _pkg/unix/runtime_

  ! <rom label="vim.tar"/>

# Mount "vim.tar" at the VFS server

  ! <tar name="vim.tar"/>

Another try of 'goa run' downloads the needed depot content and starts the
scenario. The attempt to start 'vim' results in an error message in the
Genode log:

! [init -> ...] Error: Could not open ROM session for "ncurses.lib.so"

Vim is the first Unix program that requires
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses - ncurses], which is a library for
interactive terminal applications. To make it available to our system,
add 'genodelabs/src/ncurses' to _pkg/unix/archives_ and
'<rom label="ncurses.lib.so"/>' to _pkg/unix/runtime_.

The next test run looks much better. Vim starts up successfully but is not
entirely happy:

[image goa_vim_no_tmp 60%]

Vim relies on the presence of a _/tmp/_ directory. We can satisfy it by
mounting a memory-backed <ram/> file system in our VFS server by adding
the following line to its <vfs> configuration:

! <dir name="tmp"> <ram/> </dir>

Upon the next test run, we are greeted with another error message:

[image goa_vim_no_sh 70%]

For some tasks like file globbing, Vim spawns a shell as child process and
expects the shell being available as _/bin/sh_. This default can be overridden
via the 'SHELL' environment variable. We can set the 'SHELL' environment
variable to the value "bash" by adding the following line to <config> of the
"/bin/bash" <start> node:

! <env key="SHELL" value="bash"/>

Furthermore, we can tame Vim by overriding its default configuration.

Create a file _raw/vimrc_ with the following content:
!set noloadplugins
!set hls
!set nocompatible
!set laststatus=2
!set noswapfile
!set viminfo=

Add a <rom label="vimrc"/> node to the <content> of _pkg/unix/runtime_.

Mount the "vimrc" ROM as _/share/vim/vimrc_ file at the VFS server:

! <dir name="share"> <dir name="vim"> <rom name="vimrc"/> </dir> </dir>

Finally, we can make ncurses aware of the actual terminal protocol implemented
by Genode's graphical terminal by setting the environment variable 'TERM'.
This enables the use of colors in Vim. Add the following line to the <config>
of the "/bin/bash" <start> node:

! <env key="TERM" value="screen"/>

With these changes, we are greeted with the following screen when starting
'vim' from the bash shell in our little Unix environment:

[image goa_vim_working]

We have just crafted a little Unix out of Genode's generic building blocks.
The result allows us to work with the time-tested an loved Unix core
utilities, combine them with pipes, and edit files with the full
comfort of Vim. All that has become possible with less than 150 lines of XML:

! $ wc -l raw/unix.config raw/terminal.config pkg/unix/runtime
!   89 raw/unix.config
!   10 raw/terminal.config
!   28 pkg/unix/runtime
