This section summarizes the most essential foundations of the Genode OS
Framework and Sculpt OS.

Genode architecture
===================

_TODO: relate to getting started example(s)_

Genode's system architecture follows a recursive structure in which a component
may invest a part of its resource budget in order to start child components. A
detailed account of this is given in Chapter "Recursive system structure" of the
Genode Foundations book.

The standard component used for nesting subsystems in Genode is the _init_
component. The configuration of the init component determines what child
components to start and how resources are assigned to them. A detailed account
of init's configuration is given in Chapter "System configuration" of the
Genode Foundations book.

Besides starting components and delegating resources, a parent component such
as init also establishes communication channels between its child components.
Any component may inform its parent about a service that it provides. Other
components are then able to request access to this service. Both sides adhere
to a predetermined session interfaces. A list of common session interfaces is
provided in Chapter "Common session interfaces" of the Genode Foundations book.

_TODO: distinguish native, libc and posix components_
