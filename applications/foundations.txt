This chapter summarizes the most essential foundations of the Genode OS
Framework. For a more detailed view, please refer to the Genode Foundations
book available at [https://genode.org].


Genode's init component
=======================

Genode's system architecture follows a recursive structure in which a component
may invest a part of its resource budget in order to start child components. A
detailed account of this is given in Section "Recursive system structure" of the
Genode Foundations book.

The standard component used for nesting subsystems in Genode is the _init_
component. The configuration of the init component determines what child
components to start and how resources are assigned to them. A detailed account
of init's configuration is given in Chapter "System configuration" of the
Genode Foundations book.

When executing 'goa run' or installing a runtime package on Sculpt OS, the
binary specified in its runtime file is added as a child component to a
Goa-managed or Sculpt-managed init component. The runtime package may either
consist of a single component binary or make use of the init component itself
to start multiple components in its subsystem. See Section
[Sticking together a little Unix] for an example.

Besides starting components and delegating resources, a parent component such
as init also establishes communication channels between its child components.
Any component may inform its parent about a service that it provides. Other
components are then able to request access to this service. Both sides adhere
to a predetermined session interface. A list of common session interfaces is
provided in Section "Common session interfaces" of the Genode Foundations book.

One of the most basic session interfaces is the ROM session. It provides
read-only access to binary or textual data. For instance, executable binaries
and shared libraries are provided as ROM modules. Moreover, Genode components
typically access a "config" ROM module, which contains the component's
configuration as XML. The configuration of Genode's init component, e.g.,
contains a <start> node for each child component to be started. For
illustration, let's have a look at a simple example:

! <start name="fs_rom" ram="10M">
!   <provides>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!   </provides>
!   <config/>
!   <route>
!     <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

* The _name_ attribute of the <start> node refers the name of the child
  component and is identical to the binary name.
  A different binary name can be specified by adding a <binary> sub node.
* The _ram_ attribute specifies the amount of RAM delegated to the component.
* The <provides> node contains the list of session interfaces provided by
  the component.
* The <config> node specifies the content of the component's config ROM.
* The <route> node contains routing information for the requested services.
  In this example, the _File_system_ session is routed to the child component
  named "vfs". All other services are routed to the parent component.

Note that session requests are accompanied by a session label. In order to make
session requests distinguishable by the providing component, init adds the
name of the requesting component as a prefix to the session label and separates
the parts by '" -> "'. One may use session labels to apply more fine-grained
routing rules.

Component API
=============

Genode components can be classified into the following categories depending on
the used API: native, libc and POSIX.

Native Genode components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! #include <base/component.h>
! #include <base/log.h>
!
! void Component::construct(Genode::Env &)
! {
!   Genode::log("Hello world");
! }

The _base/component.h_ header contains the interface each component must
implement.
The 'construct' function is called by the component’s execution environment to
initialize the component. The interface to the execution environment is passed
as argument. This interface allows the application code to interact with the
outside world. The simple example above merely produces a log message. The log
function is defined in the _base/log.h_ header.
The component does not exit after the 'construct' function returns. Instead, it
becomes ready to respond to requests or signals originating from other
components. The example above does not interact with other components though.
Hence, it will just keep waiting indefinitely.

Libc components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A libc-based component is not different from a regular Genode component and
reacts on events from the surrounding system. The crucial difference lies in the
semantics of the POSIX file operations, which may block on read or select.
Therefore, the 'Component::construct' function is not implemented in the
component code but in the libc. On startup, this function prepares the C
runtime, including the virtual file system, before executing the application (or
libc-using component) code. The actual application is then entered via
'Libc::Component::construct' on its own application context (stack and register
set). Consequently, Genode components that use the libc have to implement the
'Libc::Component::construct' function. The application context enables the libc
to suspend and resume the execution of the application at any appropriate time,
e.g., when waiting in select for a file descriptor to become readable.

! #include <libc/component.h>
! #include <stdio.h>
!
! void Libc::Component::construct(Libc::Env &)
! {
!   Libc::with_libc([] () {
!     printf("Hello world\n");
!   });
! }

When using libc functions in the component, the code must indicate this
intention by wrapping code into 'Libc::with_libc' defined as a function
taking a lambda-function argument in _libc/component.h_. This ensures that
code from the libc is executed exclusively by the application context and,
therefore, is suspendable.

Section [C runtime and virtual file system] provides more details on Genode's
C runtime and virtual file system.

POSIX components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using Genode's _posix_ library, it is possible to build applications that
use the well-known 'main()' function.

! #include <stdio.h>
!
! int main(int argc, char **argv)
! {
!   printf("Hello POSIX\n");
!   return 0;
! }

Internally, the _posix_ library uses _libc/component.h_ and therefore requires
configuration of the C runtime and virtual file system as explained in the
following section. In addition, the _posix_ libary looks for <arg> nodes in
the component's config ROM in order to fill the 'argv' array.
Section [A second example, using CMake] has already shown an example for this.
