Exporting and publishing
========================

_This section is based on Norman Feske's article_
_[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2020-01-16-goa-publish - Goa - publishing packets]_
_at [https://genodians.org]_.

Let's follow up on the Unix tutorial from
Section [Sticking together a little Unix] and make the scenario available in
form of a ready-to-use depot.

In Norman's Goa playground repository, you can find the results of the Unix
tutorial in the _intro_ directory. This section uses the
[https://github.com/nfeske/goa-playground/tree/master/intro/unix_3rd - unix_3rd]
subdirectory as the basis for the steps described below.

Software-publishing prerequisites
---------------------------------

In order to provide packaged software to other Genode users, you will
need the following prerequisites:

# A publicly accessible place on the web where users can download
  your software packages from.

# A PGP key pair to protect the end-to-end integrity of your packages.

This article does not cover the first point as there are so many options
when it comes to web hosting. However, the use of PGP deserves an explanation.

Genode's depot tools use Open-PGP signatures to ensure that the packages
created by you are bit-for-bit identical to the packages arrived at the user's
system. It works like this: You as the software provider create an Open-PGP
key pair consisting of a private key and a matching public key. The private
key must remain your secret. The public key should be made publicly available.

You can use your private key to put _your_ digital signature on a package.
Nobody else can forge your signature because the private key is known only
to you. Once a user has downloaded the package, the signature attached to the
package can be tested against the public key. If the package was mutated on
the way to the user's machine, e.g., the web server was compromised by an
attacker, this check would ultimately fail. The user is saved from the
risk of running non-genuine or randomly broken software. Vice versa, if the
signature check succeeds, the user can be certain to have obtained a
bit-for-bit identical copy of the package created by the owner of the private
key - the software provider.

Since you are an aspiring software provider, you ought to have an Open-PGP
key pair.


Creating a key pair using GnuPG
-------------------------------

GnuPG is the go-to implementation of the Open-PGP standard. It is usually
installed by default on GNU/Linux distributions. If you are already using GPG
for encrypting/signing email, you may, in principle, use your existing key pair.
If so, you may skip this section.

To create a new key pair, you can use the following command:

! $ gpg --full-generate-key
! gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.4; Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
! This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
! There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
! 
! Please select what kind of key you want:
!    (1) RSA and RSA (default)
!    (2) DSA and Elgamal
!    (3) DSA (sign only)
!    (4) RSA (sign only)
! Your selection? 

Stick to the default (RSA) by hitting enter. Next, you are asked for the key
size.

! RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
! What keysize do you want? (3072)

GnuPG suggests a default key size of 3072 bits. You can add a safety margin
by raising the size to 4096. Next, you are asked to decide for how long you
want to use this key.

! Please specify how long the key should be valid.
!          0 = key does not expire
!       <n>  = key expires in n days
!       <n>w = key expires in n weeks
!       <n>m = key expires in n months
!       <n>y = key expires in n years
! Key is valid for? (0)

For our use case, there is no point in limiting the key's lifetime.
Press enter to let the key never expire.

! Key does not expire at all
! Is this correct? (y/N)

The tool apparently wants to have us think twice about it. Well, typing 'y'
gives it the assurance it desires.

Next, the question about your real name. Well, for the purpose of this tutorial,
let's use "John K.".

! Real name: John K.

When asked for the email address, it's technically fine to just fill-in some
place holder.

Should you intend to widely publish your public key, e.g., by uploading it to
a key server, please consider using your real identity. You want to be trusted
by the users of your software after all, don't you? A real identity is
certainly more trustworthy than a random internet person hiding behind a
pseudonym.

! Email address: a@b.cd

Next, you can leave a comment or leave it blank by pressing enter.

! Comment:
! You selected this USER-ID:
!     "John K. <a@b.cd>"
!
! Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?

After pressing 'o', you are greeted with a dialog asking for a new passphrase.
This passphrase is used to encrypt your private key before storing it in a
file. In the event of a leak of this file, your private key remains still a
secret unless your passphrase becomes known. Hence, you should better not
write down your passphrase but keep it in your head only. Once you supplied your
passphrase, GPG confirms the creation of the new key pair with a message like
this:

! ...
! public and secret key created and signed.
!
! pub   rsa4096 2020-01-16 [SC]
!       96541E89AA71BAA88DF56C538ADB04B1F162AF2D
! uid                      John K. <a@b.cd>
! sub   rsa4096 2020-01-16 [E]

When inspecting the GPG keyring via the command 'gpg --list-secret-keys', you
can see the new key listed:

! $ gpg --list-secret-keys
! ...
! sec   rsa4096 2020-01-16 [SC]
!       96541E89AA71BAA88DF56C538ADB04B1F162AF2D
! uid           [ultimate] John K. <a@b.cd>
! ssb   rsa4096 2020-01-16 [E]


A quick look back at the project we wish to publish
---------------------------------------------------

To publish the depot content for a given Goa project, first change to the
project directory. For example, within the 'goa-playground' repository linked
above, you would change to the 'unix_3rd' directory.

! $ git clone https://github.com/nfeske/goa-playground.git

! $ cd goa-playground/intro/unix_3rd/

Before proceeding, please make sure to use the latest version of the Goa tool.

! $ goa update-goa

It is always a good idea to give the project a quick try before publishing it.

! $ goa run

Goa will download all the components needed to build the scenario, and execute
it directly on the GNU/Linux development machine. You should see a terminal
window with a bash prompt.

When peeking at the _var/public/_ directory now, you see the downloaded
archives and signatures. For example,

! $ find var/public/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/terminal
! var/public/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/terminal
! var/public/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/terminal/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! var/public/genodelabs/bin/x86_64/terminal/2023-10-24.tar.xz

The 'sig' file is the signature that was created via the private PGP
key of Genode Labs when terminal was originally published.
After downloading, Goa verifies the signature using Genode Labs' public key
that is provided at _var/depot/genodelabs/pubkey_.

When taking a look at the _var/depot/_ directory, you see the depot
content extracted from the corresponding 'tar.xz' archives.


Exporting the project to a Genode depot
---------------------------------------

Genode's package management organizes software in a so-called depot, which is a
directory with a special structure explained in Secion [Package management].
To create depot content for a project, Goa features the 'goa export'
command. Let's give it a try without a second thought.

! $ goa export

! Error: missing definition of depot user
!
!  You can define your depot user name by setting the 'depot_user' 
!  variable in a .goarc file, or by specifing the '--depot-user <name>' 
!  command-line argument.

As hinted by the error message, Goa needs to know the name of us as the
software provider. The depot user name will correspond to the subdirectory
within the depot that will host your content. Let us try the command again,
but specifying the user name "john" this time.

! $ goa export --depot-user john

! Error: version for archive john/raw/unix_3rd undefined
!
!  Create a 'version' file in your project directory, or 
!  define 'set version(john/raw/unix_3rd) <version>' in your .goarc file.

This time, Goa seems to be happy about the depot user name, but it apparently
misses any version information about the project. Indeed, while following the
steps of Section [Sticking together a little Unix], we did not talk or think
about versions at all. Now it is time to make up our minds about a suitable
version identifier.
In principle, any character string will do, as long as it does not contain
anything fancy like whitespace. It is generally a good practice to just use
the current date. Hence, let's write the version identifier into a new file
called _version_:

! $ echo 2023-11-15 > version

Let's give 'goa export' another try.

! $ goa export --depot-user john

! [unix_3rd] exported .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! Error: missing README file at pkg/unix_3rd/README

This looks like a partial success! When inspecting _var/depot/_ now, you
can indeed find content that looks pretty familiar.

! $ ls var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/

! terminal.config  unix.config  vimrc

However, let's pay attention to the 'Error:' part of the message. By
convention, each depot package features a README file, and Goa nags us to
follow this convention. We have to give in. Create a file at
_pkg/unix_3rd/README_ with content of your choice. The README should contain
a short description of the purpose of the package, along with instructions
for using it.
Note that future versions of Sculpt OS will present README texts nicely
formatted to the user. We therefore recommend following the
[https://github.com/nfeske/gosh - GOSH] markup syntax, which is consistently
used throughout Genode's documentation.

With the README file in place, let's try again:

! $ goa export --depot-user john
! Error: archive john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15 already exists in the depot
!
!  You may specify '--depot-overwrite' to replace the existing version.

Goa wants to save us from accidentally overwriting existing depot content,
which can happen, for example, if you made changes in the project but forgot to
adjust the _version_ file. In this case, however, the message results
from the partial success above that already exported _raw/unix_3rd_.
So you are safe to specify the '--depot-overwrite' argument as suggested by Goa.

Note, you may alternatively use Goa's 'bump-version' to change the version. This
command sets the version file to the current date or, if this would not change
the version, adds/increments an alphabetical suffix.

! $ goa export --depot-user john --depot-overwrite

! [unix_3rd] exported .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! [unix_3rd] exported .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15

This time, the command succeeded. To celebrate the success, review the
content of your part - john's part - of the depot.

! $ find var/depot/john/
! var/depot/john/
! var/depot/john/raw
! var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd
! var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/terminal.config
! var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/vimrc
! var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/unix.config
! var/depot/john/pkg
! var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd
! var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/archives
! var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/runtime
! var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15/README

You can nicely see here how the _version_ file defines the name of the
subdirectory of the content.


Signing and archiving
---------------------

Even though the depot content looks good, it has not yet a suitable form
for distributing it. We ultimately need to wrap the content in archive files
and apply our digital signature to these archives. Fortunately, you don't
need to do these steps manually since Goa assists with the 'publish' command.
This command implicitly executes the 'goa export' command. So you need to
specify all information that you supplied to 'export'.

! $ goa publish --depot-user john --depot-overwrite

! [unix_3rd] exported .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! [unix_3rd] exported .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! Error: missing public key at .../unix_3rd/var/depot/john/pubkey
!
!  You may use the 'goa add-depot-user' command. 
!  To learn more about this command:
!
!    goa help add-depot-user

Goa cannot know which key to use for signing the depot content. It only knows
the name of our made-up depot user "john". But you have not yet drawn the
connection to the PGP key pair you have created at the beginning of this
article. The 'goa add-depot-user' command closes the circle.

! $ goa add-depot-user john --depot-url "https://your-domain/and/url" \
!                           --gpg-user-id "a@b.cd" \
!                           --depot-overwrite

The URL specified as '--depot-url' argument should point to the designated
location of the archives on your web server. For reference, Genode Labs'
depot URL is [https://depot.genode.org/]. Note that the URL points to the
root of the depot directory structure, not the depot user's subdirectory.

The '--gpg-user-id' can be any GPG user-ID string as understood by GPG.
In the example above, we used the email address that we specified for the
GPG key pair.

The '--depot-overwrite' argument is specified because Goa tries to prevent us
from accidentally overwriting information of existing depot content, like
the content you just created with the 'goa export' command. It is interesting
to take a look at the content of the depot user "john" now.

! $ find var/depot/john/
! var/depot/john/
! var/depot/john/pubkey
! var/depot/john/download

The content you extracted before is no more. Instead, there is a fresh
subdirectory _john_ with the information you supplied to the 'goa add-depot-user'
command. Take the time to look into both files. Goa extracted the
ASCII-armored _pubkey_ from the GPG keyring by using the specified GPG user ID.

With the connection between the depot user "john" and his key pair drawn,
let us give Goa another chance to publish the project.

! $ goa publish --depot-user john --depot-overwrite

This time, Goa is able to proceed, as indicated by the following messages:

! publish .../var/public/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz
! publish .../var/public/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz

You are also asked by GPG for your passphrase for decrypting your private key.

Once the command completed, you can find the archived and signed depot content
at _var/public/john/:_

! $ find var/public/john
! var/public/john
! var/public/john/raw
! var/public/john/raw/unix_3rd
! var/public/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz.sig
! var/public/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz
! var/public/john/pkg
! var/public/john/pkg/unix_3rd
! var/public/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz.sig
! var/public/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz


Syncing the public depot content to the web server
--------------------------------------------------

The entirety of the _var/public/john_ directory can now be copied as is
to the web server. The way of how this content is uploaded is up to you.

The fantastic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync - rsync]
tool has proven to be useful for this purpose. You may use the following
combination of arguments:

! -rpltOvz --checksum --chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,o-w,+X

Please use 'man rsync' to decrypt this information.


Deployment on Sculpt OS
-----------------------

Now that you have published your first Goa project in your depot, you probably
want to give it a spin on Sculpt OS. There are two practical options for this:
You can either create a launcher file at _/config/launcher/_ or you may publish
a depot index referring to your depot package.

For both options, you need to let Sculpt OS know about from where to download
your depot archives. For a quick test, you may type in your depot URL in
the "Add" tab of the "+" menu. Be aware, however, that this circumvents any
integrity checks of the downloaded archives as your public key still remains
unknown to Sculpt.

In order to add your public key to sculpt, you first need to export it from
gpg in ASCII-armored form.

! $ gpg --export John > pubkey

The resulting _pubkey_ needs to be placed alongside the _download_ file that
was created by Sculpt in the _depot/john/_ directory when you typed in the
URL via the Sculpt UI.
You may use the "window manager" preset, which includes the "system shell"
terminal application for this purpose. In the system shell, you find the user
depot at _/rw/depot/john/_.

Writing a launcher file
-----------------------

Manually creating a launcher file is a good option for testing. The file
captures the integration of the deployed component into Sculpt and makes it
easy to adapt the archive version.

Using the system shell or the inspect view in Sculpt, you can create the
file _/config/launcher/unix_ with the following content:

! <launcher pkg="john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15">
!   <route>
!     <service name="Gui">
!        <child name="wm"/>
!     </service>
!   </route>
! </launcher>

The scenario merely requires a Gui service that we route to the "wm" component
that is deployed by the "window manager" preset. Once the launcher file is in
place, the scenario can be enabled/disabled in the "Options" tab of the
"+" menu.

For more details, please consult the
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-24-10#Runtime_management - Sculpt OS documentation].

Publishing a depot index
------------------------

A user's depot index is a curated list of the packages and their versions
provided by the user. Sculpt OS downloads the index and presents the users with
a UI for deploying the referred packages.

Fortunately, Goa assists with managing and publishing a depot index. Let's
give it a try! In the Goa playground repository, change into the _intro/_
directory and create the following index file.

! <index>
!   <supports arch="x86_64"/>
!
!   <index name="Tutorial">
!     <pkg path="unix_3rd" info="Unix terminal from tutorial"/>
!   </index>
! </index>

This file almost represents your depot index as expected by Sculpt but misses
the user and version information. Goa takes care of adding this information.
Please consult 'goa help index' for more details on the structure of index
files.

Placing the index file above the _unix_3rd/_ directory in the hierarchy enables
Goa to look up the version information from the _version_ file and publish the
referenced Goa projects if necessary. Goa simply scans the subdirectories of
the current working directory for looking up related Goa projects. You can
therefore publish your depot index together with the unix_3rd package with a
single command.

! intro$ goa publish
! [intro] exporting project .../intro/unix_3rd
! [unix_3rd] exported .../intro/var/depot/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! [unix_3rd] exported .../intro/var/depot/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15
! ...
! [intro] exported .../intro/var/depot/john/index/24.04
! publish .../intro/var/public/john/pkg/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz
! publish .../intro/var/public/john/raw/unix_3rd/2023-11-15.tar.xz
! publish .../intro/var/public/john/index/24.04.xz

After syncing your depot content to the web server. Users are able to
install your unix_3rd package via the Sculpt UI. Please refer to the Sculpt
documentation for more details.
