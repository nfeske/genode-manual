Getting started with Goa
########################

_This section is based on Norman Feske's_
_[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2019-11-24-goa - Goa article]_
_at [https://genodians.org]_.

The development of applications for Genode used to require a lot of learning
about Genode's way of organizing source code, our custom build system,
and the use of run scripts. The Goa tool aims at largely removing these burdens
from application developers.

In contrast to the tools that come with Genode, which were designed for
developing complete systems, [https://github.com/genodelabs/goa - Goa] is
focused on the development of individual applications. In a nutshell,
it streamlines the following tasks:

# The porting of 3rd-party software to Genode, which typically involves
  * Downloading 3rd-party source code via Git, Subversion, or in the
    form of archives,
  * Applying patches to the downloaded source code, and
  * Keeping track of changes locally made to the downloaded source code.

# Building software using standard build tools like CMake, alleviating
  the need to deal with Genode's custom build system.
  Goa takes care of automatically installing the required Genode APIs
  and supplying the right parameters to the build system so that Genode
  executables are produced.

# Rapidly testing the software directly on the developer's Linux host system.
  Goa automatically downloads Genode components needed for the test
  scenario.

# Since Genode executables are binary-compatible between Linux and microkernels,
  the same software as just tested on Linux can be deployed on top of the
  other kernels. Goa takes care of exporting the software in the format
  expected by Genode's package management.

# Publishing (archiving and cryptographically signing) the software so that
  it becomes available to other Genode users, in particular users of Sculpt OS.

Installation
============

# Install the latest Genode tool chain on a GNU/Linux OS on a 64-bit x86 PC.
  It is recommended to use the latest long-term support (LTS) version of
  Ubuntu. Make sure that your installation satisfies the following
  requirements.

  * _libSDL-dev_ needed to run system scenarios directly on your host OS,
  * _tclsh_ and _expect_ needed by the tools,
  * _xmllint_ for validating configurations,

  Instructions for installing the Genode tool chain are available at
  [https://genode.org/download/tool-chain].


# Clone the Goa repository:

  ! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/goa.git

  The following steps refer to the directory of the clone as '<goa-dir>'.

# Enable your shell to locate the 'goa' tool by either

  * Creating a symbolic link in one of your shell's binary-search
    locations (e.g., if you use a 'bin/' directory in your home directory,
    issue 'ln -s <goa-dir>/bin/goa ~/bin/'), or alternatively

  * Add '<goa-dir>/bin/>' to your 'PATH' environment variable, e.g.,
    (replace '<goa-dir>' with the absolute path of your clone):

    ! export PATH=$PATH:<goa-dir>/bin

# Optionally, enable bash completion by adding the following line to your
  '~/.bashrc' file:

  ! source <goa-dir>/share/bash-completion/goa


Please feel welcome to explore Goa on your own. A good starting point would
be the built-in help command:

! goa help


A first example, using a plain old Makefile
===========================================

Let's say, you want to build a hello-world application that uses the raw
Genode API with no libc whatsoever.

First, create a project directory, let's call it "hello":

! $ mkdir hello
! hello$ cd hello

By convention, the project name corresponds to the name of the directory.
Source codes are stored in a _src/_ subdirectory. Let's create a
file at _src/hello.cc_ with the following content:

! #include <base/log.h>
! #include <base/component.h>
!
! void Component::construct(Genode::Env &)
! {
!   Genode::log("Hello");
! }

Besides the _hello.cc_ file, let's create a _Makefile_ at _src/Makefile_ with
the following content:

! hello: hello.cc

Now, let's give 'goa' a first try:

! hello$ goa build

Goa responds with the following message:

! [hello] Error: hello has a 'src' directory but lacks an 'artifacts' file.
!                You may start with an empty file.

The so-called artifacts file tells Goa about the expected end result of
the build process. Even though we already know from our _Makefile_ that our
only build artifact will be the executable binary called "hello", let's
follow Goa's advise of starting with an empty _artifacts_ file. Note, you may
consult 'goa help artifacts' for more details on the artifacts file.

! hello$ touch artifacts

As a notable side effect of the 'goa build' command, Goa has created a new
directory called _var/_ within the project directory. The _var/_ directory is
the designated place for generated files such as the build directory.

Upon the next attempt of issuing the 'goa build' command, now with an
_artifacts_ file in place, Goa attempts to compile our program but with
pretty limited success:

! hello.cc:1:10: fatal error: base/log.h: No such file or directory
!  #include <base/log.h>
!           ^~~~~~~~~~~~
! compilation terminated.
! make: *** [hello] Error 1
! [hello:make] <builtin>: recipe for target 'hello' failed
! Error: build via make failed

Our program tries to include a header file that is nowhere to be found.
To resolve this problem, one can tell Goa that a project needs to use the
Genode base API, by placing a file named _used_apis_ with the following
content into the project directory.

! genodelabs/api/base

This line tells Goa that the project depends on Genode's base API, which
features the _base/log.h_ and _base/component.h_ headers. When issuing
the command 'goa build' again, you see the following message:

! download genodelabs/api/base/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/base/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig

Goa automatically downloaded the base API and installed it into a fresh
depot at _var/depot/genodelabs/api/base/2023-10-24/_. But not only that, it also
re-attempted the build of the program. If you take a look at
_var/build/x86_64/_, you will see the 'hello' executable. If the output was too
unspectacular for your taste, you may append the '--verbose' argument to the
'goa build' command to see more details about the steps taken.

To run the program, one needs to tell Goa, which part of the build artifacts
are relevant. In our case, it's the 'hello' executable binary. You
can declare this information in your _artifacts_ file by adding the following
line. It refers to the respective file relative to the _var/build/x86_64/_
directory.

! hello

If you issue the 'goa build' command again, you can see that this file appears
at _var/bin/x86_64/hello_. The content of the _bin_ directory is meant for the
integration into a Genode scenario.

Speaking of a Genode scenario, to run the program within a Genode system,
you have to define the "contract" between the program and the surrounding
system. This contract has the form of a runtime package. Let's create one
with the name "hello":

! hello$ mkdir -p pkg/hello

A runtime package needs at least two files, a _README_ file and a _runtime_
file. The _README_ file should give brief information about the purpose
of the Genode subsystem for human readers. The runtime file contains the
contractual information. Create a file _pkg/hello/runtime_ with the following
content:

! <runtime ram="1M" caps="100" binary="hello">
!   <config/>
!   <content>
!     <rom label="hello"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

This file declares the binary you want to start, how much RAM and capabilities
the subsystem expects, configuration information passed to the subsystem, and
the content of the package. In this case, you only have a single ROM module
for the binary called "hello".

Note that Goa's built-in help command provides more details on the structure of
runtime files.

! goa help runtime

For running the scenario, one can use the 'goa run' command:

! hello$ goa run

! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/init/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/bin/x86_64/init/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/src/base-linux/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/src/base-linux/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/src/init/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/src/init/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/os/2023-08-21.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/os/2023-08-21.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/report_session/2023-05-26.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/report_session/2023-05-26.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/sandbox/2023-10-03.tar.xz

! download genodelabs/api/timer_session/2023-10-03.tar.xz

! Genode sculpt-23.10
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> hello] Hello

You can see that Goa automatically installed the dependencies needed to
execute the runtime package, integrates a Genode scenario, and executes
it directly on Linux. If you switch to another terminal, you can see
the Genode processes:

! $ ps a | grep Genode
!
! 8646 pts/3    Sl+    0:00 [Genode] init
! 8649 pts/3    Sl+    0:00 [Genode] init -> hello
! 8650 pts/3    Sl+    0:02 [Genode] init -> timer

You can cancel the execution of the Genode scenario via Control-C.


A second example, using CMake
=============================

As another step, let us create a new project that executes the 2nd step
of the excellent [https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/ - CMake tutorial].
Let's call the project "cmake_step2".
Instead of copying the code into the _cmake_step2/src/_ directory, let us
better tell Goa to download the code from the original tutorial. This can
be done by creating an _import_ file in the project directory. Create the
file _cmake_step2/import_ with the following content. Please have a look
at 'goa help import' for a detailed explanation.

! LICENSE   := BSD
! VERSION   := master
! DOWNLOADS := cmake_step2.sparse-git
!
! URL(cmake_step2) := https://github.com/Kitware/CMake
! REV(cmake_step2) := HEAD
! DIR(cmake_step2) := src
! SPARSE_PATH(cmake_step2) := Help/guide/tutorial/Step2

This import file describes the download of only the specified subdirectory
of the CMake project from GitHub. Let's give it a try:

! cmake_step2$ goa import
! import  download https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/trunk/Help/guide/tutorial/Step2
! import  generate import.hash

After the command finished, you find the source code sitting nicely in a new
_src/_ directory. Let's try to build it just after creating an empty _artifacts_ file.

! cmake_step2$ touch artifacts
! cmake_step2$ goa build

! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- The C compiler identification is GNU 12.3.0
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 12.3.0

!  cmath: No such file or directory
!     2 | #include <cmath>
!       |          ^~~~~~~
! compilation terminated.

Apparently, the example requires the standard C++ library. You can supply
this API to the project by creating a _used_apis_ file with the following
content:

! genodelabs/api/posix
! genodelabs/api/libc
! genodelabs/api/stdcxx

The 'posix' API is needed because - unlike a raw Genode component - the program
starts at a 'main' function. The libc is needed as a dependency of the
standard C++ library.

When issuing the 'goa build' command again, you see that Goa downloads the
required APIs and successfully builds the example program:

! cmake_step2$ goa build

! download genodelabs/api/libc/2023-10-03.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/libc/2023-10-03.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/posix/2020-05-17.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/posix/2020-05-17.tar.xz.sig
! download genodelabs/api/stdcxx/2023-10-24.tar.xz
! download genodelabs/api/stdcxx/2023-10-24.tar.xz.sig
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Configuring done
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Generating done
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Build files have been written to: .../var/build/x86_64
! [cmake_step2:cmake] [ 50%] Building CXX object
!                     CMakeFiles/Tutorial.dir/tutorial.cxx.obj
! [cmake_step2:cmake] [100%] Linking CXX executable Tutorial
! [cmake_step2:cmake] [100%] Built target Tutorial

The resulting executable binary can be found at _var/build/x86_64/Tutorial_.
Let's declare it a build artifact by mentioning it in the _artifacts_ by adding
the following line.

! Tutorial

To run the program, you need a runtime package that is slightly more advanced
than the first hello example. This time, you need to declare that the runtime
requires content from other depot archives in addition to your program by
creating a file _pkg/cmake_step2/archives_ with the following content:

! genodelabs/src/posix
! genodelabs/src/libc
! genodelabs/src/vfs
! genodelabs/src/stdcxx

This way, the subsystem incorporates the shared libraries found in those
depot archives. A suitable _pkg/cmake_step2/runtime_ for running the program
within a Genode scenario looks like this:

! <runtime ram="10M" caps="1000" binary="Tutorial">
!
!   <config>
!     <libc stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"/>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev">
!         <log/>
!       </dir>
!     </vfs>
!     <arg value="Tutorial"/>
!     <arg value="24"/>
!   </config>
!
!   <content>
!     <rom label="Tutorial"/>
!     <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="stdcxx.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

Since the tutorial uses the C runtime, you have to supply a configuration
that defines how the virtual file system of the component looks like, and
where the program's standard output should go. The runtime also specifies the first
and second arguments of the POSIX program as "Tutorial" (name of the program)
and "24" as its actual argument. The '<content>' lists all ROM modules required.

With this runtime package in place, let's give the Tutorial a run:

! cmake_step2/$ goa run

! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Configuring done
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Generating done
! [cmake_step2:cmake] -- Build files have been written to: .../var/build/x86_64

! [init -> cmake_step2] The square root of 24 is 4.89898
! [init] child "cmake_step2" exited with exit value 0

You see that Goa takes care of downloading all dependencies needed to
host the subsystem and subsequently executes the scenario. The program
built by the tutorial prints the result "The square root of 24 is 4.89898".
