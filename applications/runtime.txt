Runtime configuration
=====================

The _runtime_ file of a package archive specifies the ingredients that are
needed to deploy the archive on a Genode system. A _runtime_ file has the
following structure:

! <runtime ram="..." caps="..." binary="...">
!   <requires>
!     <!-- required session interfaces -->
!     <nic/>
!   </requires>
!
!   <provides>
!     <!-- provided sessions interfaces -->
!   </provides>
!
!   <content>
!     <!-- required ROM modules -->
!     <rom label="..."/>
!   </content>
!
!   <config>
!     <!-- component config -->
!   </config>
! </runtime>

The runtime must define the amount of RAM, the number of capabilities and
the binary name. It also lists the required and provided session interfaces.
Note that the sub-nodes of the <requires> and <provides> are the lower-case
service names. The <content> node contains a list of required ROM modules
(e.g. binaries, libraries, config files). Furthermore, the component's config
can be added via a <config> node. For more details, please consult Goa's
built-in help:

! $ goa help runtime

The _runtime_ file is also evaluated by 'goa run' in order to set up a suitable
Genode environment on the host system.
Section [Example: Virtual networking with Goa] has illustrated how Goa uses
additional attributes and content of a <nic> node to set up virtual networking.
Please consult Goa's built-in help for an explanation of how the other services
are emulated by Goa.
