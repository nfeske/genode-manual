Porting Lomiri Calculator App
=============================

_This section is based on the_
_[https://genodians.org/jschlatow/2024-01-11-lomiri-calculator-porting - article]_
_at [https://genodians.org]._

Since the
[https://genodians.org/ssumpf/2023-05-06-ubunutu_ui - port of Ubuntu UI Toolkit to Genode],
Ubuntu Touch apps can be ported to Genode. After Canonical dropped support for
Ubuntu Touch, the toolkit was adopted by _UBports_ as a community project and
renamed to _Lomiri UI Toolkit_.

The port of the toolkit is available in the genode-world repository
(see Section [Mobile SDK based on Ubuntu/Lomiri UI Toolkit]).
Ready-to-use depot archives can be found in
[https://depot.genode.org/ssumpf - Sebastian Sumpf's depot].

This section walks through the porting procedure of the
[https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/apps/lomiri-calculator-app/ - Lomiri Calculator App]
and thereby serves as a blueprint for porting other apps from the toolkit.


Creating a new Goa project
--------------------------

Every Goa project resides in a separate directory (they can be nested, though).
Goa automatically determines whether a directory is a project directory based
on its content. Goa uses the name of the directory as a project name.

Starting a new Goa project merely consists in creating a separate directory
at an arbitrary location and supplementing directory content that is considered
by Goa.

! $ mkdir calculator

Importing the source code
-------------------------

As a first step, you need to import the app's source code. For this, you simply
create an _import_ file with the following content:

! LICENSE   := GPLv3
! VERSION   := 3.3.7
! DOWNLOADS := calc.archive
!
! APPS_URL  := https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/apps/
! BASE_URL  := $(APPS_URL)/lomiri-calculator-app/-/archive/
! URL(calc) := $(BASE_URL)/v$(VERSION)/lomiri-calculator-app-v$(VERSION).tar.gz
! SHA(calc) := 821f045e9cdb5f26145f60c53bf92f96ba81a563c0a0fec72ee1cdfccc0a9f88
! DIR(calc) := src

Syntactically, the file is a makefile that merely defines a couple of variables
documented by 'goa help import'. With the above definitions, you are importing the
source code from a tar archive. The tool also supports git and svn. Note that
the app version 3.3.7 was the last version before Ubuntu UI Toolkit got renamed
to Lomiri.

With the _import_ file present, you are able to run 'goa import', which places
the source code into the _src/_ subdirectory.

! calculator$ goa import
! import  download https://gitlab.com/ubports/[...]/lomiri-calculator-app
!                  /-/archive//v3.3.7/lomiri-calculator-app-v3.3.7.tar.gz
! import  extract lomiri-calculator-app-v3.3.7.tar.gz (calc)
! import  generate import.hash

In case the source code needs some adaptations, Goa is able to apply patches
during import (see 'goa help import' for more details). For convenience,
'goa diff' lets you easily create a patch for your local modifications.


Building the application
------------------------

Goa supports various commodity build systems such as GNU Make, autoconf, CMake,
qmake and Cargo (see 'goa help build-systems' for more details). Fortunately,
the calculator app is based on CMake, hence let's try running 'goa build':

! calculator$ goa build
! [calculator] Error: [...] has a 'src' directory but lacks an 'artifacts' file.
!              You may start with an empty file.

As mentioned in Section [Package management], Goa requires an _artifacts_ file
to build a binary archive so let's do as suggested and create an empty one.

! calculator$ touch artifacts
! calculator$ goa build
! ...
! CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
!   By not providing "FindQt5Core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
!   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Core", but
!   CMake did not find one.
! 
!   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Core" with any
!   of the following names:
! 
!     Qt5CoreConfig.cmake
!     qt5core-config.cmake
! 
!   Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
!   "Qt5Core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
!   "Qt5Core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
!   been installed.
! 
! 
! [calculator:cmake] -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Apparently, CMake is unable to locate Qt5Core. The error message suggests
providing a file named _FindQt5Core.cmake_. Goa is able to locate these files
in the used API archives. Knowing that Qt5Core is part of the _qt5_base_ archive,
let's add this to the _used_apis_ file.

! calculator$ echo 'ssumpf/api/qt5_base' > used_apis
! calculator$ goa build
! ...
! [lomiri-calculator-app] Error: no version defined for depot
!                         archive 'ssumpf/api/qt5_base'

Well, since Goa only comes with the version information of official archives
from the genodelabs depot, you have to provide the version information. This
is achieved by adding the version definition in a _goarc_ file:

! calculator$ echo 'set version(ssumpf/api/qt5_base) 2024-04-18' >> goarc
! calculator$ goa build
! ...
! CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
!   By not providing "FindQt5Qml.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
!   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Qml", but
!   CMake did not find one.
! 
!   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Qml" with any
!   of the following names:
! 
!     Qt5QmlConfig.cmake
!     qt5qml-config.cmake
! 
!   Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Qml" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
!   "Qt5Qml_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt5Qml"
!   provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
!   installed.
! 
! 
! [calculator:cmake] -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Qt5Qml is part of the _qt5_declarative_ archive. Let's add the corresponding
API archive and version information:

! calculator$ echo 'ssumpf/api/qt5_declarative' >> used_apis
! calculator$ echo 'set version(ssumpf/api/qt5_declarative) 2024-02-25' >> goarc
! calculator$ goa build
! ...
! [calculator:cmake] -- Build files have been written to:
!                       /.../goa-projects/calculator/var/build/x86_64
! ...
! [calculator:cmake] [ 98%] Built target com_ubuntu_calculator_translation_files
! [calculator:cmake] [100%] Built target pofiles_84
! [calculator:cmake] Install the project...
! [calculator:cmake] -- Install configuration: ""
! [calculator:cmake] -- Installing: //manifest.json
! CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:49 (file):
!   file INSTALL cannot copy file
!   "/.../goa-projects/calculator/var/build/x86_64/manifest.json" to
!   "//manifest.json": Permission denied.
! 
! 
! make: *** [Makefile:110: install] Error 1
! [calculator] Error: install via cmake failed:
!  child process exited abnormally

Yikes, the build succeeded but the installation failed writing to the
file-system root. This is puzzling because Goa calls 'cmake install' with
'CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= /.../var/build/<arch>/install/'. Looking at
_src/CMakeFile.txt_ reveals the 'CLICK_MODE' option, which sets
'CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH' to '/'. Fortunately, Goa allows providing arbitrary
arguments to CMake via a _cmake_args_ file. Setting 'CLICK_MODE=0' should do
the trick:

! calculator$ echo '-DCLICK_MODE=0' > cmake_args
! calculator$ goa build
! ...
! CMake Error at tests/autopilot/cmake_install.cmake:49 (file):
!   file INSTALL cannot make directory
!   "/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/ubuntu_calculator_app": Permission
!   denied.
! Call Stack (most recent call first):
!   tests/cmake_install.cmake:42 (include)
!   cmake_install.cmake:59 (include)

Apparently, there are some testing-related python files to be installed. Looking
at _src/CMakeFiles.txt_ again reveals that unsetting the 'INSTALL_TESTS'
options prevents this.

! calculator$ echo '-DINSTALL_TESTS=0' >> cmake_args
! calculator$ goa build
! 
! ...
! [calculator:cmake] -- Up-to-date: /.../goa-projects/calculator/var/build
!   /x86_64/install/bin/ubuntu-calculator-app
! ...
! [calculator:cmake] -- Installing: /.../goa-projects/calculator/var/build
!   /x86_64/install/share/locale/zh_TW/LC_MESSAGES/com.ubuntu.calculator.mo

Very nice! You got past all build and installation errors. The environment for
Ubuntu UI Toolkit apps is set up by the _ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher_, which
expects the application files in its VFS. Since the VFS allows importing files
from a tar archive, wrapping the application files into a tar archive is the
best option. You can achieve this by adding the following line the _artifacts_
file. For more details, please refer to 'goa help artifacts':

! ubuntu-calculator-app.tar: install/

Next task is defining the runtime scenario.


Writing the package runtime
---------------------------

In order to run the just built component with Goa or on Sculpt, you need a
corresponding package archive defining the runtime. Goa expects the default
package archive of a project to be named after the project, hence you need to
create a _pkg/calculator_ directory.

! calculator$ mkdir pkg/calculator

Since the _runtime_ file for Ubuntu UI Toolkit applications comprises mostly
boilerplate code, you may use any existing application as blueprint and modify
a few lines as indicated by the inline comments:

! <runtime ram="200M" caps="1000" binary="ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher">
!
!   <requires>
!     <gui/>
!     <rom label="mesa_gpu_drv.lib.so"/>
!     <gpu/>
!     <rtc/>
!     <timer/>
!     <report label="shape"/>
!   </requires>
!
!   <config>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev">
!         <log/> <gpu/> <rtc/>
!       </dir>
!       <dir name=".local"> <ram/> </dir>
!       <dir name="pipe"> <pipe/> </dir>
!       <tar name="qt5_declarative_qml.tar"/>
!       <tar name="qt5_dejavusans.tar"/>
!       <tar name="qt5_graphicaleffects_qml.tar"/>
!       <tar name="qt5_libqgenode.tar"/>
!       <tar name="qt5_libqjpeg.tar"/>
!       <tar name="qt5_libqsvg.tar"/>
!       <tar name="ubuntu-ui-toolkit_qml.tar"/>
!       <tar name="ubuntu-themes.tar"/>
!
!       <!-- change to you projects tar file here -->
!       <tar name="ubuntu-calculator-app.tar"/>
!
!     </vfs>
!     <libc stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log" pipe="/pipe" rtc="/dev/rtc"/>
!     <arg value="ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher"/>
!
!     <!-- add your startup QML file here -->
!     <arg value="/share/ubuntu-calculator-app/ubuntu-calculator-app.qml"/>
!
!     <env key="QT_SCALE_FACTOR" value="1"/>
!   </config>
!
!   <content>
!     <!-- adjust to your tar -->
!     <rom label="ubuntu-calculator-app.tar"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

With this _runtime_ file at _pkg_calculator_, you are able to execute 'goa run'.
Note that Goa automatically executes all the required stages such as importing
and building so that you don't need to worry about invoking these manually.

! calculator$ goa run
! ...
! [calculator] Error: Binary 'ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher' not mentioned as
!              content ROM module. 
! 
!  You either need to add '<rom label="ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher"/>' to the
!  content ROM list 
!  or add a pkg archive to the 'archives' file from which to inherit.

Oops! We missed putting the Ubuntu UI Toolkit package archive into the _archives_
file. Let's amend this:

! calculator$ echo "ssumpf/pkg/ubuntu_ui_toolkit" > pkg/calculator/archives
! calculator$ echo 'set version(ssumpf/pkg/ubuntu_ui_toolkit) 2024-06-03' \
! >> goarc
! calculator$ goa run
! ...
! [init -> calculator] QQmlComponent: Component is not ready
! [init -> calculator] file:///[...]/ubuntu-calculator-app.qml:23
!                      module "QtQuick.Controls.Suru" is not installed
! [init -> calculator] 
! [init -> calculator] QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running
! [init -> calculator] Error: raise(ABRT)
! [init] child "calculator" exited with exit value -1

Alright, Goa was actually able to start the scenario, yet the component seems to
miss a QtQuick style module. The Suru style package is
[https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/qqc2-suru-style - available at UBports].

In order to make Suru available on Genode, you need to create a separate Goa
project.

Porting QtQuick Controls Suru Style
-----------------------------------

Following the steps already taken for the calculator app, you create the project
directory _qt5_quickcontrols2_suru/_ with the following _import_ file:

! LICENSE   := GPLv2
! VERSION   := main
! DOWNLOADS := suru.git
! 
! URL(suru) := https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/qqc2-suru-style.git
! REV(suru) := c0cf2007
! DIR(suru) := src

These definitions create a clone of the specified git repository at the _src/_
subdirectory during import. Create an empty _artifacts_ file and give 'goa run'
a try:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ touch artifacts
! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa build
! import  download https://gitlab.com/ubports/[...]/qqc2-suru-style.git
! import  git Cloning into 'src'...
! import  update src
! import  generate import.hash
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: could not find matching qt5_base API in depot

Goa detected that this is a qmake project and is therefore looking for a
_qt5_base_ API archive. However, you haven't defined this in the _used_apis_
file yet. Let's fix this:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ echo "genodelabs/api/qt5_base" > used_apis

Note that you can benefit from the version information already
specified in the calculator's _goarc_ file. Goa reads all _goarc_ files it finds
along the path from the project directory to your home directory. You may thus
move the _goarc_ file in the directory hierarchy to share it between both
projects.

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa build
! ...
! /[...]/depot/genodelabs/api/qt5_base/[...]/include/QtCore/qglobal.h:45:12:
!       fatal error: type_traits: No such file or directory

! make: *** [Makefile:47: sub-qqc2-suru-suru-pro-make_first] Error 2
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: build via qmake failed:
!  child process exited abnormally

The build failed with the above error, which reminds us of adding
'genodelabs/api/stdcxx' and 'genodelabs/api/libc' to the _used_apis_ file.
Note that this may require adding the '--rebuild' argument to 'goa build' to
force Goa and qmake to re-create the build directory:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ echo "genodelabs/api/stdcxx" >> used_apis
! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ echo "genodelabs/api/libc" >> used_apis
! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa build --rebuild
! ...
! /[...]/depot/genodelabs/api/qt5_base/[...]/include/QtGui/qopengl.h:141:13:
!       fatal error: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory
!   141 | #   include <GL/gl.h>

! compilation terminated.

! make: *** [Makefile:47: sub-qqc2-suru-suru-pro-make_first] Error 2
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: build via qmake failed:
!  child process exited abnormally

Alright, this looks like we also need 'genodelabs/api/mesa'.

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ echo "genodelabs/api/mesa" >> used_apis
! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa build --rebuild
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru:qmake] Info: creating stash file /[...]/.qmake.stash

! collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
! ...

There are a bunch of library files missing. Goa creates these from the symbol
files found in the used API archives. 'ldso_so_support' is provided by
'genodelabs/api/so', 'qt5_component' is provided by
'genodelabs/api/qt5_component', and the Qt5 libraries are provided by
'ssumpf/api/qt5_declarative' and 'ssumpf/api/qt5_quickcontrols2'. The resulting
_used_apis_ file should therefore look like this:

! genodelabs/api/qt5_base
! genodelabs/api/stdcxx
! genodelabs/api/libc
! genodelabs/api/mesa
! genodelabs/api/so
! genodelabs/api/qt5_component
! ssumpf/api/qt5_declarative
! ssumpf/api/qt5_quickcontrols2/2023-05-26

Note that Goa allows specifying version information directly in the _used_apis_
file as done for 'ssumpf/api/qt5_quickcontrol2'.

After executing 'goa build' successfully, you may have a look at the build
directory at _var/build/x86_64_ to identify the build artifacts. For QML
modules, we need the qml files in a tar archive to be able to populate the
ubuntu-ui-toolkit-launcher's VFS. Moreover, we need the _*.lib.so_
file. Your _artifacts_ file should look like this:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru_qml.tar/qt/: qmake_root/qml
! qmake_root/qml/QtQuick/Controls.2/Suru/libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin.lib.so

Let's give 'goa build' another try:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa build
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: missing symbols file
!                           'libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin'
!
! You can generate this file by running 'goa extract-abi-symbols'

Goa recognized that you are building a library and therefore expects a symbol
file. Let's follow the advice given by Goa:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa extract-abi-symbols
! The following library symbols file(s) were created:
!   > `symbols/libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin
! Please review the symbols files(s) and add them to your repository.

After removing the comment from the generated symbol file, you should be able
to run 'goa build' successfully. In a last step, you need to export the
resulting archive into your depot. Let's assume your depot user is "john" and
that you are using _~/depot_ as a shared depot directory:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa export --depot-user john --depot-dir ~/depot
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: cannot export src archive because the
!                           license is undefined
!  
!  Create a 'LICENSE' file for the project, or 
!  define 'set license <path>' in your goarc file, or 
!  specify '--license <path>' as argument.

Fortunately, Goa reminds us of adding a _LICENSE_ file. Since
the file is already present in the _src/_ directory, you point Goa to it using
this _goarc_ line:

! set license src/LICENSE.GPL-2

Let's run 'goa export' again:

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa export --depot-user john --depot-dir ~/depot
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] Error: version for
!                           archive john/src/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru undefined
!  
!  Create a 'version' file in your project directory, or 
!  define 'set version(jschlatow/src/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru) <version>'
!  in your goarc file.

Goa features a 'bump-version' command to create/update the version file. It
simply sets the version to the current date or appends/increases a letter suffix
if the version was already set to this date.

! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa bump-version
! qt5_quickcontrols2_suru$ goa export --depot-user john --depot-dir ~/depot
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] exported .../src/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru/...
! [qt5_quickcontrols2_suru] exported .../bin/x86_64/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru/...

All done, back to the calculator project.


Revising the package runtime
----------------------------

In order to utilize the just created Suru module, you need to add the tar file
to the calculator runtime. More precisely, add a '<tar>' node to the vfs and
a '<rom>' node to the list of content ROM modules.

! <config>
!   <vfs>
!     ...
!     <tar name="qt5_quickcontrols2_suru_qml.tar"/>
!     ...
!   </vfs>
! </config>
!
! <content>
!     ...
!     <rom label="qt5_quickcontrol2_suru_qml.tar"/>
!     ...
! </content>

Before giving 'goa run' a go, don't forget to add the corresponding depot
archive to the _archives_ file.

! calculator$ echo "john/src/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru" >> pkg/calculator/archives
! calculator$ goa run
! ...
! [calculator] Error: no version defined for depot
!              archive 'john/src/qt5_quickcontrols2_suru'

Goa is unable to find any version information for the archive. Instead of adding
the version definition to a _goarc_ file, you may use Goa's ability to locate
the corresponding project directory in order to find its version information.
By default, Goa uses the working directory as a starting point for locating
those dependencies. This can be changed by adding a '--search-dir' argument or
by setting the 'search_dir' variable in a _goarc_ file. Let's opt for the latter
and also set the 'depot_dir' variable to point Goa to the depot directory to
which you exported the _qt5_quickcontrols2_suru_ project.

! calculator$ echo "set search_dir ../" >> goarc
! calculator$ echo "set depot_dir ~/depot" >> goarc
! calculator$ goa run
! ...
! [init -> calculator] Error: ROM-session creation failed
!                      (label="libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin.lib.so",...)
! [init -> calculator] Error: could not open ROM session
!                      for "libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin.lib.so"
! [init -> calculator] QQmlComponent: Component is not ready
! ...

The library file is provided by the _qt5_quickcontrols2_suru_ archive, however,
the runtime error indicates that we missed adding it to the content section of
the _runtime_ file.

! <content>
!     ...
!     <rom label="libqtquickcontrols2surustyleplugin.lib.so"/>
!     ...
! </content>

Giving 'goa run' another shot reveals another issue:

! calculator$ goa run
! ...
! [init -> calculator] QSqlDatabase: QSQLITE driver not loaded
! [init -> calculator] QSqlDatabase: available drivers:
! [init -> calculator] Warning: chmod: chmod not implemented
! [init -> calculator] QSqlQuery::prepare: database not open
! [init -> calculator] file:///[...]/engine/CalculationHistory.qml:82:
!                      Error: Driver not loaded Driver not loaded

Apparently, we need a database driver. Fortunately, _qt5_libsqlite.tar_ and
_libqsqlite.lib.so_ are part of the _qt5_base_ binary archive. Let's add them
to the _runtime_ file:

! <config>
!   <vfs>
!     ...
!     <tar name="qt5_libqsqlite.tar"/>
!     ...
!   </vfs>
! </config>
!
! <content>
!     ...
!     <rom label="qt5_libqsqlite.tar"/>
!     <rom label="libqsqlite.lib.so"/>
!     ...
! </content>

Finally, 'goa run' is able to start up the calculator app successfully. The
_fb_sdl_ window may remain white though. A random mouse click into the window,
however, lets the GUI pop up as shown below. That's good enough for now.
