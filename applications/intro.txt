Introduction
############

This document complements the Genode Foundations book with
application-level topics. It is primarily intended for application
developers. Before studying the Genode Applications material, it is
recommended to give the Genode Foundations book a read. The book can be
downloaded at [https://genode.org].

Another guide worth reading is the
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-24-10 - Sculpt OS guide].
Sculpt OS is one particular incarnation of the Genode OS Framework that puts
the user in the position of full control. With Sculpt OS, you are leaving
the well-known world of Linux. It is therefore worth familiarizing yourself with
these new grounds before building applications for it.

This document features a practical guide for developing and porting applications
to Genode. The material leverages the Goa software development kit (SDK), which streamlines
the application development for the Genode OS Framework and Sculpt OS in
particular.

Chapter [Getting started with Goa] demonstrates the use of the Goa tool in form
of a Getting Started guide. Chapter [Foundations] recapitulates the principles
of Genode's architecture as well as its most essential libraries, components, and
tooling for application developers. Chapter [Development & Debugging] provides
assistance when it comes to debugging Genode applications. Finally,
Chapter [Tutorials] completes the document by a collection of tutorials and
stories on application porting/development.
