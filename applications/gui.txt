Graphical User Interfaces
=========================

Since its first release, Genode came with its own low-level GUI stack centered
around a component called _Nitpicker GUI server_. Nitpicker provides three types
of session interfaces: GUI, Capture, and Event. Similar to the NIC router,
Nitpicker is a resource multiplexer. It mediates between framebuffer driver,
input drivers, and applications. Applications use the GUI session interface,
which provides low-level access for writing to the framebuffer and receiving
input events. Rather than sticking to low-level drawing methods, GUI frameworks
provide a more suitable level of abstraction for application development.

This section provides an overview of the available GUI frameworks for Genode.
For a more detailed explanation of Genode's low-level GUI stack, please refer to

SDL
~~~

The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a well-established cross-platform library
often used by computer games. Ports of SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0 are available in the
genode-world repository. Additional SDL libraries such as SDL_image, SDL_ttf,
SDL_net and SDL_mixer are also available.

Examples of Genode applications making use of SDL are available in the following
repositories:

Qt (5/6)
~~~~~~~~

Qt is a popular cross-platform application development framework. Early
versions of Genode already included a port of Qt4 that was later updated to Qt5
and, most recently, Qt6.
Since Genode's port of the Falkon browser bases on Qt, and QtWebengine in
particular, this is the best supported GUI framework for Genode applications.

Mobile SDK based on Ubuntu/Lomiri UI Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ubuntu UI Toolkit bases on Qt5 and particularly targets
touchscreen-optimized application development. Since UBports resumed the
development for Ubuntu Touch after Canonical dropped support, the toolkit was
renamed from _Ubuntu UI Toolkit_ to _Lomiri UI Toolkit_.

Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LVGL is a popular graphics library to create modern UIs for embedded devices.
Being optimized for embedded devices, LVGL comes with a small memory footprint.
This makes it a perfect fit for rather simple Genode applications.

Since LVGL targets embedded devices, it is typically used as a statically linked
library and stripped down to the particular needs. For Genode, however, LVGL
is available as a shared library (api/lvgl) with almost all features enabled. The
LVGL library is accompanied by a support library (api/lvgl_support) providing
the LVGL driver backends that interact with Genode's GUI session. Both libraries
are still in experimental state.
