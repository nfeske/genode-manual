Writing a VFS plugin for network-packet access
==============================================

_This section reproduces a minimal implementation of the original_
_[https://genodians.org/jschlatow/2022-03-01-vfs-tap - VFS tap plugin]_
_with Goa. The complete implementation is available in the Genode repository._

In Linux and FreeBSD, the kernel provides virtual TAP devices as an interface
for sending/receiving raw Ethernet frames. This section demonstrates
how this functionality can be added to Genode's VFS by means of a dedicated
plugin.

When porting software from the Unix world to Genode, we try to keep
modifications of the 3rd-party code to a minimum. An essential part of this
consists in providing the required libraries (e.g., libc, stdcxx). But, even with
all libraries in place, we also need to bridge the gap between the Unix
viewpoint of "everything is a file (descriptor)" and the Genode world of session
interfaces. This is where the VFS comes into play: Genode's C runtime (libc)
maps file operations to the component's VFS. Let's have a look at a common
example:

! <config>
!    <libc stdout="/dev/log"/>
!    <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev"> <log/> </dir>
!    </vfs>
! </config>

This component config tells the libc to use _/dev/log_ for stdout and use the
built-in log plugin of the VFS to "connect" _/dev/log_ to a LOG session. Section
[C runtime and virtual file system] provides an overview of libc and VFS
configuration.

For writing a VFS plugin for raw network-packet access, let's first sketch
an overview on how TAP devices are used on FreeBSD/Linux and how
this maps to the VFS architecture.

TAP-device foundations
----------------------

Genode's C runtime is based on a port of FreeBSD's libc. On FreeBSD, we simply
open an existing TAP device (e.g. _/dev/tap0_) and are
able to write/read to the acquired file descriptor afterwards. In addition,
there are a few I/O control operations (ioctl), by which we can get/set the MAC
address or get the device name for instance. Let's look at an example:

! #include <net/if.h>
! #include <net/if_tap.h>
! #include <stdio.h>
! #include <string.h>
! #include <unistd.h>
! #include <fcntl.h>
! #include <sys/ioctl.h>
! #include <stdint.h>
!
! int main()
! {
!    int fd0 = open("/dev/tap0", O_RDWR);
!    if (fd0 == -1) {
!       printf("Error: open(/dev/tap0) failed\n");
!       return 1;
!    }
!
!    char mac[6];
!    memset(mac, 0, sizeof(mac));
!    if (ioctl(fd0, SIOCGIFADDR, (void *)mac) < 0) {
!       printf("Error: Could not get MAC address of /dev/tap0.\n");
!    } else {
!       printf("MAC: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x\n", mac[0], mac[1], mac[2],
!                                                      mac[3], mac[4], mac[5]);
!    }
!
!    enum { BUFFLEN = 1500 };
!    char buffer[BUFFLEN];
!    while (1) {
!       ssize_t received = read(fd0, buffer, BUFFLEN);
!       if (received < 0) {
!          close(fd0);
!          return 1;
!       }
!
!       printf("Received packet with %d bytes\n", received);
!       size_t i=0;
!       uint32_t *words = (uint32_t*)buffer;
!       for (; i < received / 4; i++) {
!          printf("%08x ", *words++);
!
!          if (i % 4 == 3)
!             printf("\n");
!       }
!
!       uint8_t *bytes = (uint8_t*)&buffer[i*4];
!       for (i*=4; i < received; i++)
!          printf("%02x", *bytes++);
!
!       printf("\n");
!    }
! }

This application code receives Ethernet frames from tap0 and
prints out the data. For demonstrative purpose, there is also an ioctl call for
getting the MAC address of tap0. A detailed description of TAP devices in
FreeBSD is given in the corresponding
[https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?tap(4) - man page].


Architecture
------------

Before diving into the VFS, let's draw a high-level picture of how Genode's
C runtime maps file operations to the VFS.

[tikz img/vfs_tap]

The figure above illustrates the plugin structure of the VFS. A plugin provides
one or multiple files (e.g. _/dev/tap0) that are incorporated into the
directory tree of the VFS. The application is then able to perform the standard
file operations on these files. The VFS plugin typically translates these
operations into operations on a particular session interface. The C runtime also
emulates ioctl by mapping these to read/write
accesses of pseudo files (e.g. _/dev/.tap0/..._) as described in the
corresponding
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/20.11#Streamlined_ioctl_handling_in_the_C_runtime___VFS - release notes]
and
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/commit/7ac32ea60 - commit message].

By convention, an info file (e.g. _/dev/.tap0/info_) hosts an XML
report containing a single XML node named after the plugin type. The node may
comprise any number of attributes to specify parameters needed by the C runtime
to implement the particular ioctl, e.g.:

! <tap name="tap0" mac_addr="02:02:02:02:02:02"/>

In case parameters shall be modifiable, the info file can be accompanied by a
separate (writeable) file for each modifiable parameter.

The C runtime takes care of emulating the blocking semantics of read/write operations.
Internally, the C runtime uses the non-blocking 'Vfs::File_io_service' interface
to perform read/write accesses on the VFS. The 'write()' operation returns
an error if writing cannot be performed immediately. Reads are split into
'queue_read()' and 'complete_read()' methods. In order to avoid futile polling,
the latter are accompanied by a 'read_ready()' method, which returns 'true' if
there is readable data, and a 'notify_read_ready()' method by which one is able
to announce interest in receiving read-ready signals. Moreover, a 'write_ready()'
method propagates the saturation of I/O buffers to the VFS user, which becomes
important when using non-blocking file descriptors.


Usage preview
-------------

Before we start coding, let's envision how we want to use the plugin:

! <config>
!    <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev">
!          <tap name="tap0" label="tap"/>
!       </dir>
!    </vfs>
! </config>

In the above example, we mount the plugin at the _/dev/tap0_ file. The _name_
attribute of the _<tap>_ node is mandatory. The plugin shall use a NIC session
to transmit the Ethernet frames to a NIC router.  The _label_ attribute can be
used to distinguish multiple session requests at the NIC router.

Creating a new Goa project
--------------------------

Let's start with preparing the stage for the plugin by starting a new Goa
project.

! $ mkdir -p vfs_tap/src
! $ cd vfs_tap

The VFS library uses the type of the XML node to determine the name of the
plugin library to probe. More precisely, when adding a _<tap>_ node to the
config, the VFS tries to load a _vfs_tap.lib.so_. Hence, we need to tell the
build system to create a shared library with this name. Currently, Goa only
supports library projects based on CMake. Thus, you need to create the file
_src/CMakeLists.txt_ with the following content:

! cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
! project(vfs_tap)
! set(LIB_SRCS vfs_tap.cc)
! add_library(vfs_tap SHARED ${LIB_SRCS})
! set_target_properties(vfs_tap PROPERTIES PREFIX "")

The first two lines are mandatory for CMake. Line 3-4 define the library
build target and _vfs_tap.cc_ as the only source file. The last line removes the
default "lib" prefix. Without this line, the build artifact would be named
_libvfs_tap.lib.so_.

Writing the vfs_tap plugin
--------------------------

Now, let's add the first few lines to _src/vfs_tap.cc_:

! namespace Vfs {
!    struct Tap_file_system;
! }
!
! struct Vfs::Tap_file_system
! {
!    using Name  = String<64>;
!
!    struct Compound_file_system;
!    struct Local_factory;
!    struct Data_file_system;
! };
!
! /* [...] see below */
!
! extern "C" Vfs::File_system_factory *vfs_file_system_factory(void)
! {
!    struct Factory : Vfs::File_system_factory
!    {
!       Vfs::File_system
!       *create(Vfs::Env &env, Genode::Xml_node config) override
!       {
!          return new (env.alloc())
!             Vfs::Tap_file_system::Compound_file_system(env, config);
!       }
!    }
!
!    static Factory f;
!    return &f;
! }

From the forward declarations, you can already see that the 'Tap_file_system' is
composed of three parts: a 'Compound_file_system', a 'Local_factory' and a
'Data_file_system'. This is a scheme that we commonly apply when writing VFS
plugins. Let's walk through each of those step by step. Note that you could
also make 'Tap_file_system' a namespace rather than a struct. The subtle
difference here is that the struct emphasizes the inextensibility.

The plugin's entrypoint is the 'vfs_file_system_factory' method that returns a
'File_system_factory' by which the VFS is able to create a 'File_system' from
the corresponding XML node (e.g. '<tap name="tap0"/>'). We return a
'Compound_file_system' which serves as a top-level file system and which is able
to instantiate arbitrary sub-directories and files on its own by using VFS
primitives. Let's have a closer look:

! class Vfs::Tap_file_system::Compound_file_system
! : private Local_factory, public Vfs::Dir_file_system
! {
!    private:
!
!       typedef Tap_file_system::Name Name;
!
!       typedef String<200> Config;
!       static Config _config(Name const &name)
!       {
!          char buf[Config::capacity()] { };
!
!          Genode::Xml_generator xml(buf, sizeof(buf), "compound", [&] () {
!
!             xml.node("data", [&] () {
!                xml.attribute("name", name); });
!
!             xml.node("dir", [&] () {
!                xml.attribute("name", Name(".", name));
!                xml.node("info",       [&] () {});
!             });
!          });
!
!          return Config(Genode::Cstring(buf));
!       }
!
!    public:
!
!       Compound_file_system(Vfs::Env &vfs_env, Genode::Xml_node node)
!       :
!          Local_factory(vfs_env, node),
!          Vfs::Dir_file_system(vfs_env, Xml_node(
!                                  _config(Local_factory::name(node)).string()
!                               ), *this)
!       { }
!
!       static const char *name() { return "tap"; }
!
!       char const *type() override { return name(); }
! };

The 'Compound_file_system' is a 'Dir_file_system' and a 'Local_factory'. The
former allows us to create a nested directory structure from XML as we are used
to when writing a component's _<vfs>_ config. In this case, the static
'_config()' method generates the following XML:

! <compound>
!    <data name="tap0"/>
!    <dir name=".tap0">
!       <info/>
!    </dir>
! </compound>

The type of the root node has no particular meaning, yet, since it is not "dir",
it instructs the 'Dir_file_system' to allow multiple sibling nodes to be present
at the mount point. In particular, this is a _data_ file system and a
subdirectory containing an _info_ file system. The latter has a static name,
whereas the subdirectory and data file system are named after what the
implementation of 'Local_factory::name()' returns (e.g. "tap0"). Already knowing how the C runtime
interacts with the VFS, we can identify that the data file system shall provide
read/write access to our virtual TAP device whereas the subdirectory is used for
ioctl support. The _info_ file system follows the aforementioned convention and
provides a file containing a '<tap>' XML node with a name attribute.

Note, the 'type()' method is part of the 'File_system' interface and must return
the XML node type to which the plugin responds.

Next, we must implement the 'Local_factory'. As the name suggest, it is
responsible for instantiating the file systems that we used in the
'Compound_file_system', i.e. the _data_ and _info_ file system:

! struct Vfs::Tap_file_system::Local_factory : File_system_factory
! {
!    Vfs::Env          &_env;
!
!    Name         const _name;
!    Data_file_system   _data_fs { _env.env(), _env.user(), _name };
!
!    /* [...] see below */

In the first few lines of 'Local_factory', you see the instantiation of
the _data_ file system. You have already seen the forward declaration of
'Data_file_system' in the beginning. We will come back to this after we completed
the 'Local_factory'. Let's first continue with the _info_ file system:

! struct Vfs::Tap_file_system::Local_factory : File_system_factory
! {
!    /* [...] see above */
!
!    struct Info
!    {
!       Name const &_name;
!
!       Info(Name const & name)
!       : _name(name)
!       { }
!
!       void print(Genode::Output &out) const
!       {
!          char buf[128] { };
!          Genode::Xml_generator xml(buf, sizeof(buf), "tap", [&] () {
!             xml.attribute("name", _name);
!          });
!          Genode::print(out, Genode::Cstring(buf));
!       }
!    };
!
!    Info                                 _info          { _name };
!    Readonly_value_file_system<Info>     _info_fs       { "info", _info };
!
!    /* [...] see below */

For the _info_ file system, we use the 'Readonly_value_file_system' template
from _os/include/vfs/readonly_value_file_system.h_. As the name suggests, it
provides a file system with a single read-only file that contains the value of
the given type. More precisely, the string representation of its value. In case
of the _info_ file system, we want to fill the file with '<tap name="..."/>'.
Knowing that we are able to convert any object to 'Genode::String' by defining a
'print(Genode::Output)' method, we can use the 'Info' struct as a type for
'Readonly_value_file_system' and customize its string representation at the same
time.

The remaining fragment of the 'Local_factory' comprises the constructor, an
accessor for reading the device name from the _<tap>_ node and the
'File_system_factory' interface.

! struct Vfs::Tap_file_system::Local_factory : File_system_factory
! {
!    /* [...] see above */
!
!    Local_factory(Vfs::Env &env, Xml_node config)
!    :
!       _env(env),
!       _name(name(config))
!    { }
!
!    static Name name(Xml_node config)
!    {
!       return config.attribute_value("name", Name("tap"));
!    }
!
!    /***********************
!     ** Factory interface **
!     ***********************/
!
!    Vfs::File_system *create(Vfs::Env&, Xml_node node) override
!    {
!       if (node.has_type("data")) return &_data_fs;
!       if (node.has_type("info")) return &_info_fs;
!
!       return nullptr;
!    }
! };

The 'create()' method is the more interesting part. Here, it returns either the
_data_ or _info_ file system depending on the XML node type. The function is
called by the 'Dir_file_system' on the XML config defined by the
'Compound_file_system'.

Note that mutable parameters need to be provided as additional writeable
files along with the info file. For this purpose, you may use the
'Value_file_system' template from _os/include/vfs/value_file_system.h_ together
with 'Genode::Watch_handler' to react to file modifications.

The last missing piece of our puzzle is the 'Data_file_system'. Luckily, there
is no need to take a deep dive into the VFS internals because
'Vfs::Single_file_system' comes to the rescue. It already implements big parts
of the 'Directory_service' and the 'File_io_service' interface, and leaves
only a handful methods to be implemented by 'Data_file_system'.
Let's have a look at the first fragment:

! class Vfs::Tap_file_system::Data_file_system : public Vfs::Single_file_system
! {
!    private:
!
!       struct Tap_vfs_handle : Single_vfs_handle
!       {
!          /* [...] see below */
!       };
!
!       using Registered_handle = Genode::Registered<Tap_vfs_handle>;
!       using Handle_registry   = Genode::Registry<Registered_handle>;
!       using Open_result       = Directory_service::Open_result;
!
!       Genode::Env            &_env;
!       Handle_registry         _handle_registry { };
!
!    public:
!
!       Data_file_system(Genode::Env       & env,
!                        Vfs::Env::User    & vfs_user,
!                        Name        const & name)
!       :
!          Vfs::Single_file_system(Node_type::TRANSACTIONAL_FILE, name.string(),
!                                  Node_rwx::rw(), Genode::Xml_node("<data/>")),
!          _env(env)
!       { }
!
!       static const char *name()   { return "data"; }
!       char const *type() override { return "data"; }
!
!       /* [...] see below */

Let's skip the details of 'Tap_vfs_handle' for the moment.
You see that we use a 'Genode::Registry' to manage the
'Tap_vfs_handle'. The 'Single_file_system' constructor takes a node type, a
name, an access mode and an 'Xml_node' as arguments. For the node type, you can
choose between 'CONTINUOUS_FILE' and 'TRANSACTIONAL_FILE'. Since a network
packet is supposed to be written as a whole and not in arbitrary chunks, we must
choose 'TRANSACTIONAL_FILE' here. The file name is
determined from the provided XML node by looking up a _name_ parameter. Here, we
pass an empty _<data/>_ node, in which case, the 'Single_file_system' uses the
second argument as a file name instead.

Let's continue with completing the 'Directory_service' interface:

! class Vfs::Tap_file_system::Data_file_system : public Vfs::Single_file_system
! {
!    private:
!
!       /* [...] see above */
!
!    public:
!
!       /* [...] see above */
!
!       /*********************************
!        ** Directory service interface **
!        *********************************/
!
!       Open_result open(char const  *path, unsigned flags,
!                        Vfs_handle **out_handle,
!                        Allocator   &alloc) override
!       {
!          if (!_single_file(path))
!             return Open_result::OPEN_ERR_UNACCESSIBLE;
!
!          unsigned handles = 0;
!          _handle_registry.for_each([&handles] (Tap_vfs_handle const &) {
!             handles++;
!          });
!          if (handles) return Open_result::OPEN_ERR_EXISTS;
!
!          try {
!             *out_handle = new (alloc)
!                Registered_handle(_handle_registry, _env, _vfs_user, alloc,
!                                  *this, *this, flags);
!             return Open_result::OPEN_OK;
!          }
!          catch (Genode::Out_of_ram)  {
!             return Open_result::OPEN_ERR_OUT_OF_RAM; }
!          catch (Genode::Out_of_caps) {
!             return Open_result::OPEN_ERR_OUT_OF_CAPS; }
!       }
!
! }

The only method of the 'Directory_service' interface not implemented by
'Single_file_system' is the 'open()' method. First, we use a helper method
'_single_file' to check whether the correct path was given. Second, we ensure
that the file has not been opened yet since the FreeBSD man page says that a TAP
device is exclusive-open. Third, we allocate
a new 'Tap_vfs_handle', which is conveniently put into the '_handle_registry' by
using the 'Genode::Registered' wrapper. The latter also takes care that the
handle is removed from the registry on destruction.

The read and write operations are part of the 'File_io_service' interface. This
interface is already implemented by 'Single_file_system', which forwards most
methods to 'Single_vfs_handle'. Let's thus look at 'Tap_vfs_handle', which
implements the read and write operations and translates them to the
NIC session interface (details omitted for conciseness). Note that
'Single_file_system' forwards 'complete_read()' to the handle's 'read()' method
and always returns 'true' for 'queue_read()'.

! class Tap_vfs_handle : public Single_file_system::Single_vfs_handle
! {
!    private:
!
!       using Read_result    = File_io_service::Read_result;

!          _notifying = true;
!          return true;

!       /* [...] (see below) */
! };

The _Tap_vfs_handle_ defines an signal-handler method '_handle_read_avail()' that notifies the C
runtime or the VFS server of any progress. There are two types of progress
notifications: I/O progress and read ready. The latter we have already come
across when mentioning the 'notify_read_ready()' method of the
'File_io_service'. In this implementation, we issue a read-ready response
whenever the 'notify_read_ready()' was called before on this file handle.
Similarly, we keep track of whether a 'read()' operation is unable to complete
via the '_blocking' member variable. By calling 'wakeup_vfs_user()', the C
runtime is notified of the fact that there was I/O progress, and it may retry
the read operation. Note that the C runtime stalls any application-level signals
when in a blocking operation, hence the '_read_avail_handler' must be declared as
'Io_signal_handler'.

! class Tap_vfs_handle : public Single_file_system::Single_vfs_handle
! {
!       /* [...] (see above) */
!
!       bool read_ready() const override
!       {
!          /* [...] */
!       }
!
!       bool write_ready() const override
!       {
!          /* [...] */
!       }
!
!       Read_result read(char *dst, file_size count,
!                        file_size &out_count) override
!       {
!          if (!read_ready()) {
!             _blocked = true;
!             return Read_result::READ_QUEUED;
!          }
!
!          /* [...] */
!
!          return Read_result::READ_OK;
!       }
!
!       Write_result write(char const *src, file_size count,
!                          file_size &out_count) override
!       {
!          if (!_nic.tx()->ready_to_submit())
!             return Write_result::WRITE_ERR_WOULD_BLOCK;
!
!          /* [...] */
!
!          return Write_result::WRITE_OK;
!       }
! };

The last ingredient is inserting the proper result types: While 'READ_OK' and 'WRITE_OK'
are self-explanatory, there are two common result types for unsuccessful
reads/writes. On the one hand, 'READ_QUEUED' indicates that a previously queued
read cannot be completed. On the other hand, we may return 'WRITE_ERR_WOULD_BLOCK'
if, e.g., the submit queue of the NIC session's transmit channel is full.

Building the VFS library with Goa
---------------------------------

With the source code in place, you can try building the plugin with Goa. For this
purpose, Goa needs to know what APIs are used by the source code. This is
achieved by listing them in the _used_apis_ file. It's a good practice to start
with the most obvious ones.

! vfs_tap$ cat used_apis
! genodelabs/api/base
! genodelabs/api/os
! genodelabs/api/vfs
! genodelabs/api/nic_session


Now, create an _artifacts_ file mentioning _vfs_tap.lib.so_ and try 'goa build':

! vfs_tap$ echo "vfs_tap.lib.so" > artifacts
! vfs_tap$ goa build
! [vfs_tap] Error: no version defined for depot archive
!   'genodelabs/api/nic_session'

Apparently, Goa lacks any version information for the NIC session API. This
information can be added by the following line in a _goarc_ file.

! set version(genodelabs/api/nic_session) 2023-11-29

Now, give 'goa build' another try:

! vfs_tap$ goa build
! ...
! [vfs_tap:cmake] [100%] Linking CXX shared library vfs_tap.lib.so
! [...]/ld: cannot find -l:ldso_so_support.lib.a: No such file or directory

Oh yes, building a shared library requires adding the _so_ API to the
_used_apis_ file.

! vfs_tap$ echo "genodelabs/api/so" >> used_apis
! vfs_tap$ goa build
! [vfs_tap:cmake] -- Configuring done (0.0s)
! [vfs_tap:cmake] -- Generating done (0.0s)
! [vfs_tap:cmake] -- Build files have been written to: [...]/var/build/x86_64
! [vfs_tap:cmake] [ 50%] Building CXX object
!   CMakeFiles/vfs_tap.dir/vfs_tap.cc.obj
! [vfs_tap:cmake] [100%] Linking CXX shared library vfs_tap.lib.so
! [vfs_tap:cmake] [100%] Built target vfs_tap
! [vfs_tap] Error: missing symbols file 'vfs_tap'
!  
!  You can generate this file by running 'goa extract-abi-symbols'.

Well, Goa noticed that you are building a shared library object and expects
a symbols file. Usually, when we create a library with Goa, we also want to
export an API archive which comprises the header files and the exported symbols
to allow linking against the library's ABI. This, however, is not needed for
a VFS plugin library. You may therefore use an empty symbols file to satisfy
Goa.

! vfs_tap$ mkdir symbols
! vfs_tap$ touch symbols/vfs_tap
! vfs_tap$ goa build
! ...
! [vfs_tap:cmake] [100%] Built target vfs_tap

Yay, you've successfully built the VFS plugin.

Testing the plugin
------------------

Let's create a simple test application that uses the VFS plugin. For this, you
need a separate project directory with a _src_ subdirectory:

! vfs_tap$ mkdir -p test-vfs_tap/src

You'll also need to use the same depot dir, which can be achieved by adding the
following lines to the _goarc_ file:

! vfs_tap$ echo "set depot_dir  ./var/depot"  >> goarc
! vfs_tap$ echo "set public_dir ./var/public" >> goarc

With these settings in place, you are able to export your _vfs_tap_ archive.
Let's assume your depot user is "john". Don't forget to initialize the version
file and to add a _LICENSE_ file. You may start with an empty file for testing:

! vfs_tap$ goa bump-version
! vfs_tap$ touch LICENSE
! vfs_tap$ goa export --depot-user john
! [vfs_tap] exported [...]/var/depot/john/src/vfs_tap/2024-08-02
! [vfs_tap] exported [...]/var/depot/john/bin/x86_64/vfs_tap/2024-08-02

Now, you need to add some code for the test application. Simply use the example
code from the very beginning of this section and place it in the file
_test-vfs_tap/src/test-vfs_tap.cc_. Also add a _Makefile_, an _artifacts_ file
and a _used_apis_ file:

! vfs_tap$ echo "test-vfs_tap: test-vfs_tap.cc" > test-vfs_tap/src/Makefile
! vfs_tap$ echo "test-vfs_tap" > test-vfs_tap/artifacts
! vfs_tap$ echo "genodelabs/api/libc"  >  test-vfs_tap/used_apis
! vfs_tap$ echo "genodelabs/api/posix" >> test-vfs_tap/used_apis

In order to run the test application, you need to define a runtime scenario.
The Genode repository contains a ping application that you can use for
generating some network traffic. When both, the ping component and the test
application connect to the same domain of a NIC router, you should be able to
see some output of the test application. For this purpose, create the following
_runtime_ file at _test-vfs_tap/pkg/test-vfs_tap_:

! <runtime ram="20M" caps="1000" binary="init">
!    <requires> <timer/> </requires>
!
!    <config>
!       <parent-provides>
!          <service name="PD"/>
!          <service name="CPU"/>
!          <service name="LOG"/>
!          <service name="ROM"/>
!          <service name="Timer"/>
!       </parent-provides>
!
!       <default caps="100"/>
!       <default-route>
!          <service name="Nic"> <child name="nic_router"/> </service>
!          <any-service>        <parent/>                  </any-service>
!       </default-route>
!
!       <start name="test-vfs_tap">
!          <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!          <config>
!             <libc stdout="/dev/log"/>
!             <vfs>
!                <dir name="dev"> <log/>
!                                 <tap name="tap0"/> </dir>
!             </vfs>
!          </config>
!       </start>
!
!       <start name="nic_router">
!          <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!          <provides> <service name="Nic"/>
!                     <service name="Uplink"/> </provides>
!          <config verbose_domain_state="yes" verbose="yes">
!             <default-policy domain="default"/>
!             <domain name="default" interface="10.0.2.1/24"/>
!          </config>
!       </start>
!
!       <start name="ping">
!          <resource name="RAM" quantum="4M"/>
!          <config interface="10.0.2.2/24" gateway="10.0.2.1"
!                  dst_ip="10.0.2.123" period_sec="5" verbose="no"/>
!       </start>
!    </config>
!
!    <!-- [...] see below -->
! </runtime>

! <runtime>
!    <!-- [...] see above -->
!
!    <content>
!       <rom label="test-vfs_tap"/>
!       <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!       <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!       <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
!       <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!       <rom label="vfs_tap.lib.so"/>
!       <rom label="ping"/>
!       <rom label="nic_router"/>
!    </content>
!
! </runtime>

Goa also needs to know in what archives it can find the content ROM modules
mentioned in the _runtime_ file. This is achieved by the following _archives_
file at _test-vfs_tap/pkg/test-vfs_tap_:

! genodelabs/src/init
! genodelabs/src/libc
! genodelabs/src/vfs
! genodelabs/src/posix
! genodelabs/src/nic_router
! john/src/vfs_tap
! jschlatow/src/ping/2024-04-11

Now, you can give the test scenario a try:

! vfs_tap$ goa run -C test-vfs_tap/
! Genode sculpt-24.04
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 18997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] static IP config: interface ...
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] NIC sessions: 0
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] initiated domain
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] NIC sessions: 1
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] NIC sessions: 2
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> test-vfs_tap] MAC: 02:02:02:02:02:02
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> nic_router] [default] forward ARP request for local
!   IP to all interfaces of the sender domain
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> test-vfs_tap] Received packet with 42 bytes
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> test-vfs_tap] ffffffff 0202ffff 01020202 01000608
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> test-vfs_tap] 04060008 02020100 01020202 0202000a
! [init -> test-vfs_tap -> test-vfs_tap] ffffffff 000affff 027b
