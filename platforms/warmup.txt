Getting acquainted with the target platform
===========================================

The undertaking of bringing Genode - and Sculpt OS in particular - to a new
ARM SoC comes with a great deal of uncertainties, namely the inner functioning
of overly complex hardware, picking appropriate tools and methodologies,
taking informed decisions about porting versus developing drivers, and
relating all this to Genode.

Combined, these uncertainties pose a huge barrier. At Genode Labs, we have
conquered this barrier a few times in the past, e.g.,
for supporting the NXP i.MX8 SoC. However, the porting of Genode to new
hardware should not be left as an activity exclusive to Genode Labs. In order
to assist developers outside of Genode's inner circle with joining the fun,
we'd like to share what we know. This sharing should have the form of profound
documentation that serves as a guide and removes points of friction as much as
possible.

To deliver substance, I figured that I should not merely talk the talk by
speaking from past experience, but also walk the walk again while writing down
my practical steps as I go. So I went forward looking around for tasty
hardware, when [https://www.pine64.org/ - Pine64] caught my eyes.


Why Pine64?
-----------

I got excited about Pine64 for several reasons.

First, devices in the form factors of the PinePhone and the A64 development
boards are readily available at affordable prices. The Pine64 website carries
a very positive message, highlighting community, openness, sustainability,
transparency, no marketing nonsense.

Second, the products are designed for hackability. This is evidenced by the
vibrant developer community, mainline Linux kernel support, and the
availability of literally more than a dozen Linux distributions. One can boot
the PinePhone directly from SD-card. How cool is that!

Third, the used Allwinner SoC - introduced as early as 2015 - is rather aged.
In contrast to bleeding-edge hardware, I would not need to explore unconquered
territory. Others have hopefully discovered most pitfalls before me. The SoC
seems to strike a nice balance of modern features (64 bit, multi core,
virtualization) with modest complexity. The performance of the SoC is notably
at the lower end of the smartphone product category. From the perspective of
an operating-systems developer, I don't see this as a con but more as a
welcome challenge. Will Genode be able to shine on such a constrained device?
Let's find out!

The only downside of the SoC worth mentioning is the lack of an IO-MMU as
protection mechanism against rampant I/O devices or drivers. So the sandboxing
of device drivers can never be water-tight.


Getting a first impression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ordered a Pine64-LTS board [1], a PinePhone [2], and a serial cable [3]
for the PinePhone directly from the online store. For some kind
of safety reason, the phone had to be ordered separately. In hindsight, we
better had ordered a power supply for the Pine64-LTS board as well. We skipped
it as we already have kilograms of AC power supplies of other boards at hand.
However, it turned out that kilograms of power supplies with 5mm connectors
are of little use when the board features a less mainstream 3.5mm connector.
Such details matter sometimes.

[3] [https://pine64.com/product/pinebook-pinephone-pinetab-serial-console/]

For getting our hands dirty with technical work, we will have to leave the
PinePhone alone for a while and turn our attention to the *Pine-A64-LTS* board.
Pine64 wiki [4] provides the perfect staring point.

Booting an officially supported GNU/Linux image
-----------------------------------------------

The wiki lists numerous ready-to-use Linux distributions.
I went for [https://www.armbian.com - Armbian]. Just a few minutes later,
after downloading the disk image [1], writing the image to an
SD card, connecting an HDMI display and a USB keyboard, and booting the
board with the SD card inserted, I was greeted with Armbian login, allowing
me to login as root user.

[1] [https://dl.armbian.com/pine64so/Buster_current]

At this point, I'm most interested in getting a first overview of the
hardware. The following information are insightful:

! root@pine64so:/# cat /proc/cpuinfo
! ...
! root@pine64so:/# cat /proc/meminfo

Well, that is not too surprising. It's more like a ritual.

! root@pine64so:/# dmesg | less

The kernel boot log is quite chatty. The following lines caught my eyes.

again...

The kernel log is not the only place revealing information about the hardware.

! ...

! 40000000-bdffffff : System RAM

Here, we get a complete view of the physical-memory layout, including
the locations of all memory-mapped devices as well as the actual RAM. The
(almost) 2 GiB of physical memory does not start at 0 but rather at 0x40000000.

! root@pine64so:/# cat /proc/interrupts

Here, we see how the relationship between devices, interrupt numbers, and
CPUs (interrupt routing) as configured by the Linux kernel.

Another point of interest is the device tree that can be found at
_/proc/device-tree_, which is actually a symbolic link to
_/sys/firmware/devicetree/base_.

At this point, it is too early to digest all this information. Let's save
it for later. The easiest way is storing data on a USB stick.

# When plugging in a USB stick to the second USB port, the kernel's 'dmesg'
  output tells us that it is detected as _/dev/sdb_ as well as the partitions,
  e.g., _/dev/sdb1_ for the first partition.

# Knowing the device name of the partition, we can mount its file system
  at _/mnt_ via 'mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt'.

# Now we can copy any files interest to '/mnt/'.


As an additional function test, one can quickly give the *network interface* a
try. Once when plugging in a network cable to our local network, the LED
on the network PHY starts blinking happily, and 'ifconfig' reveals that
the board got an IP address from our local DHCP server.
A quick 'wget https://genode.org' works just as expected.


Serial line
-----------

Knowing that the board is fully functional when running a Linux-based OS,
we have to work towards using the board as an embedded development target.
Textual output over *serial* is the most important prerequisite for that.
The times when development boards featured 9-pin D-SUB connectors is long
past. Nowadays, we need to look out for the right pins on one of the board's
expansion sockets. The board has several of them. So now is a good time
to get acquainted with the board's schematics.

:Pine-A64-LTS board schematics:

  [https://files.pine64.org/doc/SOPINE-A64/PINE%20A64-TLS-20180130.pdf]

The schematics hint at several serial devices (UART). E.g.,
UART1 at the SDIO WIFI + BT pin header. The go-to solution is not obvious.
Fortunately, a little web search later, we land on a nice wiki page [2]
describing the UART on Pine64.
In particular, we learn "Better always use UART0 on the EXP connector nearby,
accessible on pins 7 (TXD), 8 (RXD), 9 (GND)."

[2] [https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64]

Everyone should have a few TTL-232R-RPi
cables at hand. If you don't, hurry up and order some.
Pay attention to signal level. In our case, the board needs a 3.3V cable.
All we need is cross-connecting TX to RX, RX to TX, and ground to
ground.

On Linux-based development machines, we usually use
picocom as serial terminal program. When
connecting the USB cable, the Linux kernel's 'dmesg' output tells us about the
new device _/dev/ttyUSB0_, which we can readily access with picocom.

[4] [https://www.mankier.com/1/picocom]

! picocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

When pressing enter, we are greeted with the login of Armbian.

For the next steps, display and keyboard are no longer needed.
All we need is the serial line.


JTAG
----

I'm hopeful that serial output will suffice for most debugging work. However,
in desperate situations like when facing cache-coherency issues, a JTAG
debugger like Lauterbach or Flyswatter can really save the day (or the week).
So when encountering a new board, we always look out for JTAG debugging pins.
If present, we get the cozy feeling of having this option available as a last
resort.

In the case of the Pine64, we must live without this cozy feeling. While
searching the forum [https://forum.pine64.org], I learned that the SoC is
indeed equipped with JTAG pins but the wiring of the Pine board does not make
them accessible.
Apparently, there is too little interest in JTAG by the community at large,
which is perfectly understandable. Most users don't mess around at the low
level where JTAG becomes the tool of choice.


The U-Boot boot loader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

U-Boot [1] is widely regarded as _the_
canonical boot loader for ARM platforms, and we Genode developers agree.
The primary reason for our high opinion is U-Boot's ability to fetch boot
images over the network from a TFTP server, which is fundamental to our
work flows.

[1] [https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot]

The secondary reason is that U-Boot brings the hardware into a state that is
convenient for the booted operating system. For example, since U-Boot prints
messages over serial, it needs to initialize the serial controller correctly,
fiddly stuff like setting up the baud rate or powering the USB FUE.
With those preparations done by the boot loader, Genode's drivers can
conveniently skip those steps and still work nicely.

The third great benefit of U-Boot to us is the arsenal of drivers supported by
the project. Granted, we don't actually use most of those drivers in practice.
But others are using them. So the drivers work reliably, are well maintained,
and are usually much less complex compared to drivers found in the Linux
kernel. This makes the drivers a very useful reference while developing
drivers for Genode.

Since Armbian uses U-Boot, we can in principle keep using it.
During the boot, one can press <space> at the serial terminal to intercept
the automated boot. This brings us to the interactive U-Boot prompt.


Building U-Boot from source
---------------------------

Building the boot loader from source is not just an affair of honor, it also
fosters our understanding and our full control over the boot process. The
ability to control the boot loader is empowering and can serve as an
experimentation ground.
The steps for building U-Boot manually for Allwinner-based devices are
described in the excellent documentation [1].

[1] [https://linux-sunxi.org/Mainline_U-Boot]

For reference, here are the steps I took.

# Cloning the git repository and checking a recent release branch:

  ! $ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
  ! $ cd u-boot
  ! u-boot$ git checkout -b v2020.10 v2020.10

# Looking out for a suitable default configuration for the Pine64-LTS board,
  guessing it would have something like "pine" in the name:

  ! u-boot$ find configs/ | grep -i pine
  ! configs/pinebook-pro-rk3399_defconfig
  ! configs/sopine_baseboard_defconfig
  ! configs/pine64_plus_defconfig
  ! configs/pine64-lts_defconfig
  ! configs/pinebook_defconfig
  ! configs/pine_h64_defconfig

  Well, _pine64-lts_defconfig_ sounds like I'm lucky for the Pine64 board.
  But the PinePhone is notably absent.
  A look at [https://linux-sunxi.org/PinePhone] clarifies the situation:
  "As we currently do not have any specific U-Boot config for this device, Use
  the pine64-lts_defconfig build target temporarily as a hack." That's fine
  by me.


# Building the ARM Trusted Firmware

  The ARM Trusted Firmware is the effort to unify low-level firmware
  interfaces - think of the bring-up secondary CPU cores - across SoC vendors.
  A dedicated article [1] by Stefan Kalkowski goes into more detail.

  The building steps described at linux-sunxi.org are easy to follow.
  For us, the build output is quite instructive for guiding our attention.

  ! $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=sun50i_a64 DEBUG=1 bl31
  ! ...
  ! CC      drivers/allwinner/axp/axp803.c
  ! CC      drivers/allwinner/axp/common.c
  ! CC      drivers/allwinner/sunxi_msgbox.c
  ! CC      drivers/allwinner/sunxi_rsb.c
  ! ...
  ! CC      plat/allwinner/sun50i_a64/sunxi_power.c
  ! CC      plat/common/plat_gicv2.c
  ! ...
  ! Built /home/no/pine64/arm-trusted-firmware/build/sun50i_a64/debug/bl31.bin successfully

  There are many more lines. They point us to interesting details. For example,
  _drivers/allwinner/axp/axp803.c_ contains the default settings of the AXP
  power-management chip,
  _plat/allwinner/sun50i_a64/sunxi_power.c_ tells us how the AXP chip is
  accessed via memory-mapped I/O.

# Installing the boot loader on the SD-card

  The steps are described in detail at
  [https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card].
  For me, it is great to see the option of using a GPT partitioning
  scheme, which we already use for Sculpt OS on PC hardware.
  This will hopefully become handy at a later stage.

A few useful U-Boot commands
----------------------------

When booting U-Boot from our freshly prepared SD card, we can see U-Boot
initializing and probing a bunch of devices.
In our current situation, *booting over the network* is the most important
functionality. So we turn our attention to the 'bootp' command.

! => help bootp
! bootp - boot image via network using BOOTP/TFTP protocol
!
! Usage:
! bootp [loadAddress] [[hostIPaddr:]bootfilename]

Let's give it a quick try. My development machine has the IP address
10.0.0.32 within the local network and happens to have a TFTP server running.
Just for the test, I put a little file called _something_ into the TFTP
directory and issue the following command to U-Boot:

! =>  bootp 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/something
!
! TFTP from server 10.0.0.32; our IP address is 10.0.0.178
! Filename '/var/lib/tftpboot/something'.
! Load address: 0x42000000

Of course, I don't want to manually type this command on every boot.
It is much better to tell U-Boot to execute the command automatically
for us. This is possible by customizing U-Boot's 'bootcmd' environment
variable.

! => help editenv
! editenv - edit environment variable
!
! Usage:
! editenv name
!     - edit environment variable 'name'
!
! => editenv bootcmd
! edit: bootp 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/something

With the 'bootcmd' customized to our liking, lets save the new setting.
U-Boot provides the command 'saveenv' for that, which stores the settings
at a predefined location on the MMC / SD card.

! => saveenv 
! Saving Environment to FAT... Card did not respond to voltage select!
! Failed (1)

Well, this did not work as anticipated. The reason is that there are two
MMC devices present. The SD-card is connected to the first MMC controller
whereas U-Boot is apparently configured to store its environment via the
second MMC controller. Fortunately, the latter setting can be configured
in U-Boot's build configuration.

Inside the _u-boot/ .config_, we find a variable
CONFIG_ENV_FAT_DEVICE_AND_PART.
In the interactive 'menuconfig', the corresponding setting is located at the
_Environment_ sub menu:

! (1:auto) Device and partition for where to store the environemt in FAT

Changing the setting to 0:auto should do the trick.
Of course, we have to go again through the steps of building U-Boot and
writing it to the SD-card. But that is a small price to pay for the
convenience that awaits us.

Next time in U-Boot, editing the 'bootcmd' again to our liking and invoking
the 'saveenv' command makes us smile:

! => saveenv 
! Saving Environment to FAT... OK

From now on, we can save a number of key strokes on each boot. One final
tweak would increase our comfort even more. By default, U-Boot initializes
the USB controller at boot time. This takes a few seconds, delaying our
boot time. Since we don't plan to boot from any USB device during our
development workflow, it is better to *skip the USB initialization*. This
can be done by changing the 'preboot' environment variable from "usb start" to
nothing, and of course make the change persistent via the 'saveenv' command.
