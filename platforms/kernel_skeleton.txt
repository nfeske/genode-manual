Kernel skeleton
===============

Of the several kernels supported by the Genode OS framework, the so-called
base-hw kernel is our go-to microkernel for ARM-based devices. Section
7.7. "Execution on bare hardware"
of the Genode Foundations book goes into detail about its underlying software
design. This section describes the process of porting this kernel to a new
board, specifically the Pine-A64-LTS single-board computer.

Equipped with the bare-metal serial-output facility developed in the
previous section, we are eager to turn
our attention to the kernel. Before attempting the porting of the kernel to
the new board, however, it is recommended to run it first on one of the
already supported boards to have a working reference.
In the case of the Pine-A64 board, which is based on an Allwinner multi-core
64-bit ARM SoC, the closest approximation would be the NXP i.MX8Q EVK board,
which ticks the boxes ARM, multi-core, and 64-bit.
At the very least, one should give the kernel a try using Qemu's virtual
pbxa9 board, which is a 32-bit platform. Even though this board has not much
in common with ours, it is still useful for seeing how the various bits and
pieces described below are supposed to work together.


A tour through the code base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The starting point of our line of work will be the existing board support
for the i.MX8Q EVK. To get an idea of the amount of work ahead of us, let's
examine the source tree within Genode's
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-imx - genode-imx] repository for
occurrences of the board's name. The search pattern "imx8" is a good start.

! $ find repos/imx -type f | grep imx8

We can ignore everything inside the _recipes/_ directory for now. This
directory contains package descriptions. We will come back to the packaging
topic later. With the focus on the kernel, we can further ignore anything
related to "drivers", "boot", "git", or "sculpt".
The use of 'grep -v' allows us to hide these distractions from our view.

! $ find repos/imx -type f | grep imx8q_evk  | grep -v recipes \
!                          | grep -v drivers | grep -v uboot \
!                          | grep -v git     | grep -v sculpt
! repos/imx/src/u-boot/imx8q_evk/target.mk
! repos/imx/src/include/hw/spec/arm_64/imx8q_evk_board.h
! repos/imx/src/core/board/imx8q_evk/board.h
! repos/imx/src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk/platform.cc
! repos/imx/src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk/board.h
! repos/imx/run/framebuffer_imx8q_evk.run
! repos/imx/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw-imx8q_evk.mk
! repos/imx/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw-imx8q_evk.mk
! repos/imx/board/imx8q_evk/image_link_address
! repos/imx/board/imx8q_evk/devices
! repos/imx/board/imx8q_evk/arch


On the one hand, it is nice to see such a small number of files to be
concerned about. On the other hand, those files appear quite scattered
throughout the source tree with a deep hierarchy, which is a bit confusing.
To lift the clouds, let's have a look at the source-tree structure.

[tikz img/imx8q_evk_files]

The files appearing under _lib/mk/_ are build-description files for libraries.
There are two such files, having the file extension '.mk'. They are located in
a sub directory called _spec/arm_v8/_, which means that the
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/development/Build_system.html - build system]
considers them only when building for an instruction set architecture that
matches ARMv8.

Distinction between bootstrap and core
--------------------------------------

Given the set of files depicted above, we can immediately spot two
construction sites, namely "bootstrap" and "core". The distinction between
those two parts is illustrated in the following picture.

[tikz img/base_hw_boot_steps]

The *bootstrap* program is started by the boot loader while the CPU is running
in physical mode. The MMU is disabled at this point.
Only one CPU - usually referred to as the boot CPU - is active. Bootstrap is
tasked with all the dirty and quirky work needed in preparation to bring up
the so-called core component.
This involves board-specific trickery like tweaking clocks and voltages,
setting up the page tables for executing the core program in virtual memory,
enabling the MMU, the initialization of additional CPU cores, and the
ELF-loading of the core ELF executable. Once these steps are taken, bootstrap
passes the control to the core component and ceases to exist.

The *core* component contains the microkernel executed in privileged mode.
When using Genode on a traditional microkernel like NOVA or seL4, core
is the first user-level program started by the kernel. It is usually
called roottask. In contrast, when using base-hw as we are going to do now,
core and the kernel are one single program. Core _is_ the microkernel at the
root of Genode's component tree. Hence, in the following, the terms core and
kernel are used synonymously.

Core is executed with the MMU enabled.
It is globally mapped at the upper part of the virtual address space.
To operate as the kernel, it contains basic drivers for the interrupt
controller, kernel timer (for preemptive scheduling), cache maintenance,
and cross-CPU synchronization.
For the interplay with the user level components running on top of core,
it features code paths for exiting the kernel into the user land and,
vice versa, for entering the kernel from the user land (syscalls, exceptions,
interrupts).
Functionality-wise, it implements mechanisms for inter-component
communication, asynchronous notifications, physical-memory allocation, the
management of virtual address spaces, and the world-switching between virtual
machines (if used as a hypervisor). In short, everything a microkernel needs
to do and - more importantly - nothing a microkernel shouldn't do.


Review of the board-specific code
---------------------------------

Before starting the work on the new board support, let us briefly look into
each of the files for the existing i.MX8q EVK board we discovered via find
and grep above.

In the list of files, we spot three header files, one _board.h_ header under
_src/bootstrap/_, one _board.h_ header under _src/core/_, and one
_imx8q_evk_board.h_ header under _src/include/_. The former two files
are specific for bootstrap and core, whereas the latter contains definitions
useful for both programs. The _board.h_ files are located in directories
named after the board. With this structure, generic (board-agnostic) code
can '#include <board.h>'. The build system picks the right _board.h_ file
by adding the board-specific directory to the include-search path.

Let us start with with definitions used across bootstrap and core.

:_repos/imx/src/include/hw/spec/arm_64/imx8q_evk_board.h_:

! #include <drivers/uart/imx.h>
! #include <hw/spec/arm/boot_info.h>
!
! namespace Hw::Imx8q_evk_board {
!     using Serial = Genode::Imx_uart;
!
!     enum {
!         RAM_BASE   = 0x40000000,
!         RAM_SIZE   = 0xc0000000,
!
!         UART_BASE  = 0x30860000,
!         UART_SIZE  = 0x1000,
!         UART_CLOCK = 250000000,
!     };
!
!     static constexpr Genode::size_t NR_OF_CPUS = 4;
!
!     namespace Cpu_mmio {
!         enum {
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_DISTR_BASE  = 0x38800000,
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_DISTR_SIZE  = 0x10000,
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_VT_CPU_BASE = 0x31020000,
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_VT_CPU_SIZE = 0x2000,
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_REDIST_BASE = 0x38880000,
!             IRQ_CONTROLLER_REDIST_SIZE = 0xc0000,
!         };
!     };
! }

Both bootstrap and core need to know the memory-mapped device registers for
the UART device to print diagnostic messages. The UART driver
(_drivers/uart.imx.h_) is included. The 'Serial' type refers to the
concrete UART driver implementation as present on the board. Thanks to this
definition, generic code is able to rely on the UART functionality via the
type name 'Serial'.

The start and size of physical memory must be known by both bootstrap and
core. So it is defined here.

Both bootstrap and core access the interrupt controller. Whereas bootstrap
performs the one-time initializations needed in order to start secondary CPU
cores, core drives the interrupt controller at runtime.


The bootstrap-specific files concern build descriptions and actual code.
The build description looks as follows.

:_repos/imx/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw-imx8q_evk.mk_:

! REQUIRES = hw
!
! REP_INC_DIR += src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk
!
! SRC_CC  += bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk/platform.cc
! SRC_CC  += bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv3.cc
! SRC_CC  += bootstrap/spec/arm_64/cortex_a53_mmu.cc
!
! vpath bootstrap/% $(REP_DIR)/src
!
! include $(call select_from_repositories,lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw.inc)

The i.MX8 SoC uses the GICv3 as interrupt-controller.
Hence, the driver gicv3.cc is included.
In contrast, as we learned from the Linux boot log, the Allwinner A64 SoC
uses the GICv2 interrupt controller.

The MMU driver differs between the various ARM versions. The
i.MX8 is based on A53 CPU cores. The Allwinner A64 uses the same.

The strange looking '$(call select_from_repositories...)' is a mechanism
for accessing files across different source repositories. You can find the
mechanism described in Section 5.3. "Build system" in the Genode Foundations
book.

: \clearpage

:_repos/imx/src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk/board.h_:

! #include <hw/spec/arm_64/imx8q_evk_board.h>
! #include <hw/spec/arm_64/cpu.h>
! #include <hw/spec/arm/gicv3.h>
! #include <hw/spec/arm/lpae.h>
!
! namespace Board {
!     using namespace Hw::Imx8q_evk_board;
!
!     struct Cpu : Hw::Arm_64_cpu
!     {
!         static void wake_up_all_cpus(void*);
!     };
!
!     using Hw::Pic;
! }

The Board namespace aggregates the knowledge of the board details that
matter to the bootstrap code, namely the specific interrupt controller
(gicv3.h) and the declaration of the 'wake_up_all_cpus' function.
The 'Board' namespace hosts the 'Pic' (programmable interrupt controller)
type, which allows the generic code of bootstrap to interact with the
interrupt controller without knowing the exact type of device.

:_repos/imx/src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk/platform.cc_:

! Bootstrap::Platform::Board::Board()
! :
!   early_ram_regions(Memory_region { ::Board::RAM_BASE, ::Board::RAM_SIZE }),
!   late_ram_regions(Memory_region { }),
!   core_mmio(Memory_region { ::Board::UART_BASE, ::Board::UART_SIZE },
!             Memory_region { ::Board::Cpu_mmio::IRQ_CONTROLLER_DISTR_BASE,
!                             ::Board::Cpu_mmio::IRQ_CONTROLLER_DISTR_SIZE },
!             Memory_region { ::Board::Cpu_mmio::IRQ_CONTROLLER_REDIST_BASE,
!                             ::Board::Cpu_mmio::IRQ_CONTROLLER_REDIST_SIZE })
! {
!     ::Board::Pic pic {};
!
!     ... incomprehensible magic spells, some gibberish about GPIO, CCM, PLL ...
! }
!
! void Board::Cpu::wake_up_all_cpus(void * ip)
! {
!     ... more magic spells, digressing into assembly code ...
! }

The 'early_ram_regions', 'late_ram_regions', and 'core_mmio' data structures
are initialized with the known ranges of physical memory and memory-mapped
I/O registers. This information is designated to be passed further to core.

The call of '::Board::Pic pic {};' performs basic interrupt-controller
initialization that is needed only once.
It is followed by a sequence of board-specific tweaks to bring the
board into a defined state for the kernel to rely on. For instance,
setting the I/O MUX configuration, default voltages, and frequencies.
The U-boot boot loader already does a fine job for establishing a
base line but it is rather conservative. The code for the i.MX8 EVK
boosts the voltages and frequencies for improving the performance.

The 'wake_up_all_cpus' call invokes a hook to enable secondary CPU cores.
The used mechanism varies from board to board, specifically depending
on the operation of the ARM Trusted Firmware. We have to brace ourself
for some investigation once we look into multi-processor support.
At the beginning, however, we will use only the boot CPU. So we can
ignore this function for now.

Finally, let's turn our attention to the core-specific files.

:_repos/imx/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw-imx8q_evk.mk_:

! REP_INC_DIR += src/core/board/imx8q_evk
! REP_INC_DIR += src/core/spec/arm/virtualization
!
! # add C++ sources
! SRC_CC += kernel/vm_thread_on.cc
! SRC_CC += spec/arm/gicv3.cc
! SRC_CC += spec/arm_v8/virtualization/kernel/vm.cc
! SRC_CC += spec/arm/virtualization/platform_services.cc
! SRC_CC += spec/arm/virtualization/vm_session_component.cc
! SRC_CC += vm_session_common.cc
! SRC_CC += vm_session_component.cc
!
! #add assembly sources
! SRC_S += spec/arm_v8/virtualization/exception_vector.s
!
! # include less specific configuration
! include $(call select_from_repositories,lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw.inc)

Core needs to know the type of the interrupt controller because
it processes interrupts at runtime. Here, the GICv3 driver is incorporated.

We can ignore the files with 'vm_*' and 'virtualization' in their names
for now. They are important for hosting virtual machines. Since the
virtualization support is a generic feature of the ARM CPU, we don't
have to take board-specific precautions.

: \clearpage

:_repos/imx/src/core/board/imx8q_evk/board.h_:

! #include <hw/spec/arm_64/imx8q_evk_board.h>
! #include <spec/arm/generic_timer.h>
! #include <spec/arm/virtualization/gicv3.h>
! #include <spec/arm_v8/cpu.h>
! #include <spec/arm_64/cpu/vm_state_virtualization.h>
! #include <spec/arm/virtualization/board.h>
!
! namespace Board {
!     using namespace Hw::Imx8q_evk_board;
!
!     enum {
!         TIMER_IRQ           = 14 + 16,
!         VT_TIMER_IRQ        = 11 + 16,
!         VT_MAINTAINANCE_IRQ = 9  + 16,
!         VCPU_MAX            = 16
!     };
! }

In addition to the aggregation of headers matching the board and SoC - like
the generic timer driver - we see the definitions of just the few interrupt
numbers that are important to core. The kernel is completely oblivious
about all other peripheral devices.

The VCPU_MAX definition is solely used for the dimensioning of an
array that keeps the state of virtual CPUs for virtual machine.
It is not important for now.

To wrap up our review, let me draw your attention to the files at
_imx/board/imx8q_evk/_, namely _image_link_address_, _devices_, and _arch_.
The _image_link_address_ and _arch_ files contain parameters that are
evaluated by Genode's run tool during the creating of boot images, whereas
the _devices_ file declares the peripheral devices to be put under the
supervision of the platform driver - a topic we will touch later in
Section [One Platform driver to rule them all].


A new home for the board support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to add support for a new board is the mirroring of the
files introduced above.
We could march forward with adding new files and directories to a
new branch of the Genode repository.
Alternatively, the Genode build system allows us to host our custom
board-specific files in a dedicated source repository that we can
maintain independently from the Genode main repository.
The latter approach has the following advantages.

First, it reinforces a clean separation between board-specific code from
generic Genode code. In particular, the _segregation of code_ constricts the
working set of files relevant for a given board, keeping only important code
in view.

Operationally, it allows the decoupling of _code ownership_ in terms of
responsibility, quality assurance, licensing hygiene, development
process, and the choice of source hosting.

Finally, it alleviates the pressure to agree on one big joint code base,
_removing_ potential points of _friction_ between developers.

In the following, we will put our code into a new repository named
_allwinner_.

! mkdir repos/allwinner

In principle, the directory can be anywhere but I find it practical to
host it under the _repos_ directory of the Genode source tree.
One may also opt to use a symlink, e.g., _repos/allwinner_ pointing to
_~/src/genode-allwinner.git_.

We need to come up with with a concise name for our board support.
Throughout Genode, we follow certain *naming conventions*. In particular, we
use underscore '_' for tightly coupled words, and minus '-' for loosely
coupled terms. For example, in the file name _core-hw-imx8q_evk.mk_,
"imx8q_evk" belong closely together whereas the words "core" and "hw" are used
as some kind of category (read: the "core" component for the "hw" kernel for
the "imx8q_evk" board). With the background of these conventions, the board
name *pine_a64lts* seems sensible. Specific enough while still concise.

For the initial content from our new _allwinner_ repository be blatantly
mirror the files of the base-hw repository.

[tikz img/mirror_imx8_pine]

At the current stage, we are concerned about getting the build process right.
To concentrate at this one thing at a time, let us pretend that the
Pine-A64-LTS board works equal to the i.MX8 EVK. We don't mind that the
technicalities copied from the existing board don't match our new board until
we run the code on the board. That said, as the build-description files (those
with the 'mk' suffix) steer the build process, they must be made consistent
with our directory structure. So we have to revisit those files while looking
out for the pattern 'imx8q_evk'.

A look into _lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_ reveals the
following line:
! REP_INC_DIR += src/bootstrap/board/imx8q_evk
We have to replace it with
! REP_INC_DIR += src/bootstrap/board/pine_a64lts

Similarly, _allwinner/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_ contains the
line:
! REP_INC_DIR += src/core/board/imx8q_evk
This must be changed to
! REP_INC_DIR += src/core/board/pine_a64lts


System-integration dry-run
--------------------------

Let us see how the Genode build system swallows - or chokes on - our new board
support. First, we need a build directory for the ARMv8 architecture.

! $ ./tool/create_builddir arm_v8a
! Successfully created build directory at /.../genode/build/arm_v8a.
! Please adjust /.../genode/build/arm_v8a/etc/build.conf according to your needs.

As suggested, we open _build/etc/build.conf_ in our favorite text editor.
Normally, I enable parallel builds by uncommenting the corresponding line
right at the beginning of the file. But for now, let us keep it disabled
until the skeleton builds successfully. The steps of the build system are
easier to follow if it operates deterministically.

We need to extend the 'REPOSITORIES' variable with the path to our custom
repository. For the _allwinner_ repository, that would be following line:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/allwinner

Note that the order of REPOSITORIES defines the search order of the build
system for files.
If the _allwinner_ repository should be able to override content
of the other repositories, specifically base-hw, the above line should appear
before the others.

With these changes in place, we can issue the build of bootstrap for new
board.

! $ cd build/arm_v8a
! $ make bootstrap/hw KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
!  ...
!  Library bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts
!    ...
!    MERGE    bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.lib.a
!  Program bootstrap/hw/bootstrap_hw_pine_a64lts

The result can be found in the sub directory _bootstrap/hw/_. We find
a single object file named _bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.o_ along with a stripped
version of this file.

Likewise, core for the base-hw kernel and the new board can be built as
follows.

! $ make core KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
!    ...
!    MERGE    core-hw-pine_a64lts.lib.a
!  Program core/hw/core_hw_pine_a64lts

Similar to the build of bootstrap, we can find the result at the corresponding
subdirectory, here _core/hw/_. We find a single archive file named
_core-hw-pine_a64lts.a_ along with a stripped version of this file.

Next up, we are going to build a *system image* that contains both core and
bootstrap.
Now would be a good time to enable parallel builds. Edit the _etc/build.conf_
file by un-commenting the following line (removing the hash '#' character).

! #MAKE += -j4

One may also opt to write the BOARD and KERNEL arguments directly into the
_build.conf_ file as illustrated by the commented-out examples. This
spares the need to specify the arguments each time when issuing a build
command.

A system image contains bootstrap, core, and additional boot modules.
The first two puzzle pieces are already in place. But what about the boot modules?
In contrast to bootstrap and core, which are always the same for each
system scenario, the boot modules vary between system scenarios.
Genode system scenarios are defined in the form of run scripts.
The run script at _repos/base/run/log.run_ is a good starting point.
As defined by this particular run script, the system image for the "log"
system scenario is comprised of core, init, ld.lib.so, init, and test-log in
addition to a configuration. A system image (image.elf) for this scenario
would look like this:

[tikz img/base_hw_system_image]

Genode's run tool automates the process of assembling such Matryoshkas from
the various pieces. Let's give it a try:

! $ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
! ...
! ... long sequence of compile steps
! ...
! genode build completed
! using 'ld-hw.lib.so' as 'ld.lib.so'
! core link address is 0xffffffc000000000
!
! Error: unknown image link address
!
!  File board/pine_a64lts/image_link_address not present in any repository.
!
! Makefile:329: recipe for target 'run/log' failed

This message should prompt us to have closer look at the run tool.

! $ cd genode
! $ grep -r "unknown image link address" tool
! tool/run/boot_dir/hw: puts stderr "\nError: unknown image link address\n"

The file _tool/run/boot_dir/hw_ is the part of the run tool that defines
the integration of a system image from its parts for the base-hw kernel.
It is worth skimming over the file to get a rough understanding of how
the system image is assembled from its ingredients. The error message
above comes from the function 'bootstrap_link_address' called during the
system-image integration step.

The link address is evaluated by the boot loader when loading the system image
as ELF binary. It defines the start of the text segment of the system image in
physical memory. As the physical memory layout differs between SoCs and
boards, we must provide a value that is suitable for the memory layout of the
Pine-A64-LTS board. From looking at Linux' _/proc/iomem_, we remember that the
system RAM of our board starts at 0x40000000.

As indicated by the error message above, the run tool expects to find
the link address in a file called _board/pine_a64lts/image_link_address_.
Let's create such a file with a sensible value. It is common practice
to leave some room at the very beginning of the memory, which is often
occupied by the boot loader. It is usually fine to link the system image to
64 KiB after the start of the physical memory.

! $ cd allwinner
! $ mkdir -p board/pine_a64lts
! $ echo 0x40010000 > board/pine_a64lts/image_link_address

With the link address defined, another attempt to build the system image for
the log scenario succeeds. The result can be found in the build directory's
_var/run/_ sub directory:

! $ find var/run
! var/run
! var/run/log.boot_modules.o
! var/run/log
! var/run/log/boot
! var/run/log/boot/image.elf
! var/run/log.core
! var/run/log.bootstrap
! var/run/log.config

The most interesting file is certainly _var/run/log/boot/image.elf_, which is
the final system image. To quickly validate the link address, let's check the
ELF entrypoint.

! $ readelf -a var/run/log/boot/image.elf | grep Entry
!   Entry point address:               0x40010000

The value looks familiar. While we are at it, the other files are also worth
inspecting.

:_var/run/log.boot_modules.o_: is an aggregate of all boot modules of the
  system scenario.

:_var/run/log.core_: is an ELF binary of core without the boot
  modules. The binary contains all debug information. This is handy for
  debugging the core component. For example, using this binary, the
  instruction pointer of a page fault within core can be related to the
  matching source code using 'objdump'.

:_var/run/log.bootstrap_: is an ELF binary of the bootstrap code without
  core and the boot modules. As for the core log.core binary, it is handy
  for debugging the bootstrap code.

:_var/run/log.config_: is the 'config' boot module passed to the initial
  init component. It corresponds to the snippet passed the 'install_config'
  function as found in the _log.run_ script.

By the way, one may prefer booting a uImage instead of an ELF image because a
uImage is compressed using gzip by default, which reduces the boot time. The
run tool supports that via the argument '--include image/uboot'. One can
either extend the RUN_OPT variable by adding a corresponding line to
_etc/build.conf_ or pass the option to the make command line:

! $ RUN_OPT='--include image/uboot' make run/log BOARD=pine_a64lts KERNEL=hw

After completing the build, the uImage file can be found at
_var/run/log/uImage_.

This is not magic. At this point, I recommend taking a look at the run tool's
snippets located at _tool/run/_. In particular, _tool/run/image/uboot_
contains the sequence of commands used for generating the uImage from the
ELF image.


Getting to grips using meaningful numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The faux system image that we just created contains information cowardly
copied from the imx8q_evk board, and which certainly mismatches the
pine_a64lts board. So let's revisit the files in our repository one by one and
look out for any numbers. Numbers are important. According to my experience,
hexadecimal numbers are especially important. Don't forget to squinch your
eyes when looking at them. Change them with caution.

:_lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_:

The following line catches our attention:
! SRC_CC  += bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv3.cc

The i.MX8 SoC uses ARM's Generic Interrupt Controller version 3 (GICv3).
From booting Linux on the Pine-A64 board, we learned that the Allwinner SoC
uses the GIC version 2. Fortunately, the base-hw kernel supports both
versions. So we can change the line to:
! SRC_CC  += bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv2.cc


:_lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_:

We merely also have to adjust the GIC version from 3 to 2.

:_src/bootstrap/board/pine_a64lts/platform.cc_:

The file contains a lot of i.MX8Q-specific initialization steps like
tweaking clocks and voltages. We can remove this code without looking back.
The body of the 'Bootstrap::Platform::Board' constructor can be reduced
to the mere initialization of the interrupt controller:
! {
!   ::Board::Pic pic { };
! }

The list of memory regions passed to the 'core_mmio' member can be
pruned to the single entry for the UART. The other entries that refer
to the IRQ controller should be removed because they refer to the wrong
version of the GIC anyway. We will supplement the proper regions for the
GICv2 later, once we turn our attention to interrupts.
! core_mmio(Memory_region { ::Board::UART_BASE, ::Board::UART_SIZE })

At this point, I am admittedly unsure about the 'wake_up_all_cpus' implementation,
in particular whether the opcode of the CPU_ON smc instruction would
match. I guess not. We will come to multi-processor support at a later
stage. So let's better remove the uncertainty by reducing
the implementation to
! void Board::Cpu::wake_up_all_cpus(void *) { }

:_src/bootstrap/board/pine_a64lts/board.h_:

We see several things that cry for adjustment.

* Updating the include guards
* Including the correct board definitions by replacing
  ! #include <hw/spec/arm_64/imx8q_evk_board.h>
  by
  ! #include <hw/spec/arm_64/pine_a64lts_board.h>
* Incorporating the GICv2 driver instead of the GICv3 driver by changing
  ! #include <hw/spec/arm/gicv3.h>
  to
  ! #include <hw/spec/arm/gicv2.h>
* Defining the C++ type 'Pic' such that it refers to the 'Hw::Gicv2' driver:
  ! using Pic = Hw::Gicv2;

:_src/include/hw/spec/arm_64/pine_a64lts_board.h_:

To our despair, the file is full of numbers.

* It includes the driver for the UART used for printing debug messages.
  Of course, the specified drivers/uart/imx.h driver won't work.
  While experimenting with the bare-metal serial output,
  we have learned that the Allwinner SoC uses a NS16550 UART controller. Let
  us pretend having a driver by changing the line to
  ! #include <drivers/uart/ns16550.h>

* The board-specific name space should reflect the name of our board:
  ! namespace Hw::Pine_a64lts_board {

* We want the C++ type 'Hw::Serial' to refer to our hypothetical NS16550
  driver.
  ! using Serial = Genode::Ns16550_uart;

* The RAM_BASE and RAM_SIZE values must match those we found from the
  look at Linux _/proc/iomem_.
  ! RAM_BASE = 0x40000000,
  ! RAM_SIZE = 0x7e000000,

* We already have found known-good values for UART_BASE and UART_SIZE
  during our bare-metal serial output experimentation. The UART_CLOCK
  value won't be needed in our case. So we define it as zero.
  ! UART_BASE  = 0x1c28000,
  ! UART_SIZE  = 0x1000,
  ! UART_CLOCK = 0,

* The NR_OF_CPUS value can stay unmodified because the Allwinner SoC has 4
  cores.

* The IRQ_CONTROLLER_REDIST_BASE and SIZE are not used for the GICv2.
  So the values can be removed.

* The values for IRQ_CONTROLLER_DISTR_BASE and SIZE as well as
  VT_CPU_BASE and SIZE will become important once
  we will turn our attention to the interrupt controller. But this is not
  today. So we keep the existing numbers, keeping in mind that they won't
  work.

* When using the GICv2, we need to add the definition of
  IRQ_CONTROLLER_CPU_BASE and VT_CTRL_BASE.
  Until we use interrupts, we can pick an
  arbitrary number. To display good manners, let's leave the lowest 12 bits
  to zero, pretending that each device resource starts at a page boundary.
  ! IRQ_CONTROLLER_CPU_BASE     = 0xaaaaa000,
  ! IRQ_CONTROLLER_VT_CTRL_BASE = 0xbbbbb000,

: \clearpage

:_/src/core/board/pine_a64lts/board.h_:

The file contains mostly interrupt numbers. We will turn our attention to
interrupts later. Let's not touch them for now because we cannot validate
the values anyway at this point. Apart from these numbers, a few adjustments
must be made.

* Updating the include guard
* Including the board definitions from _pine_a64lts_board.h_
* Adjusting the GIC version of the included header from _gicv3.h_ to _gicv2.h_
* Importing the board-specific namespace 'Hw::Pine_a64lts_board'

To wrap up this step, let's check if we missed any leftover by grepping for
remaining occurrences of patterns like "imx" or "gicv3".
! $ grep -ri imx repos/allwinner

Now would also be a good time to revisit the file headers, updating the
information about the author, creation date, brief description, and copyright.
Should the code be considered to eventually become part of the Genode upstream
project at some point, it is sensible to leave the license disclaimer as is,
clarifying that the code is designated be a part of the Genode OS framework.


UART driver for bootstrap and core
----------------------------------

The next attempt to build the system image for the log scenario fails
predictably:

! $ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
! ...
!     COMPILE  core_region_map.o
! In file included from /.../repos/allwinner/src/core/board/pine_a64lts/board.h:17,
!                  from /.../repos/base-hw/src/core/platform.h:37,
!                  from /.../repos/base-hw/src/core/core_region_map.cc:18:
! /.../repos/allwinner/src/include/hw/spec/arm_64/pine_a64lts_board.h:17:10:
!            fatal error: drivers/uart/ns16550.h: No such file or directory
!  #include <drivers/uart/ns16550.h>
!           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can find a number of blueprints for our new UART driver at
_repos/base/include/drivers/uart/_. By following the lines of the existing
drivers and combining our knowledge from the bare-metal serial experiments,
we can come up with the following little driver placed
at _allwinner/include/drivers/uart/ns16550.h_.

! #include <util/mmio.h>
!
! namespace Genode { class Ns16550_uart; }
!
!
! class Genode::Ns16550_uart : Mmio
! {
!   private:
!
!     struct Thr : Register<0x00, 32>
!     {
!       struct Data : Bitfield<0,8> { };
!     };
!
!     struct Lsr : Register<0x14, 32>
!     {
!       struct Thr_empty : Bitfield<5,1> { };
!     };
!
!   public:
!
!     Ns16550_uart(addr_t const base, uint32_t, uint32_t) : Mmio(base) { }
!
!     void put_char(char const c)
!     {
!       while (read<Lsr::Thr_empty>() == 0);
!
!       write<Thr::Data>(c);
!     }
! };

Like all drivers dedicatedly developed for Genode, it uses Genode's 'Register'
API to safely access bits of memory-mapped I/O registers. You can find the API
described in Section 8.18 "Utilities for user-level device drivers" in the
Genode-Foundations book.


Climbing the mountain step by step
----------------------------------

We are almost there. On our walk, we repeatedly try to build the system image,
look at the compiler and linker errors, fix them, and repeat.

! $ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
!     ...
!     COMPILE  bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv2.o
! /.../repos/base-hw/src/bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv2.cc:
!                     In constructor 'Hw::Gicv2::Gicv2()':
! /.../repos/base-hw/src/bootstrap/spec/arm/gicv2.cc:23:28:
!                     error: 'NON_SECURE' is not a member of 'Board'
!   bool use_group_1 = Board::NON_SECURE &&
!                             ^~~~~~~~~~

The interrupt-controller driver apparently needs to distinguish the cases where
the kernel is running in the so-called "secure world" or "normal world" of
ARM TrustZone. If you want to learn more about schizophrenia as a feature
of ARM processors, let me point you to
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/trustzone - our article on ARM TrustZone].
Admittedly, I'm not completely sure about which of both worlds are executing
our kernel. But it is probably safe to assume that the boot process switches
to the normal world before loading and starting our system image.
So we add the definition of NON_SECURE to
_allwinner/src/bootstrap/board/pine_a64lts/board.h_.

! namespace Board {
!   ...
!   static constexpr bool NON_SECURE = true;
! }

The next slope on our way up the hill:

! $ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
!     ...
!     MERGE    bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.lib.a
! /.../genode-aarch64-ar: bootstrap/board/pine_a64lts/platform.o:
!                         No such file or directory
! /.../repos/base/mk/lib.mk:180: recipe for target
!                                'bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.lib.a' failed

We have to guide the build system to consider source files in the _allwinner_
repository, by adding the following line to
_lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/bootstrap-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_.

! vpath bootstrap/% $(REP_DIR)/src

: \clearpage

Next try. This time, we get a link error:

! /.../aarch64-none-elf/bin/ld: debug/core-hw-pine_a64lts.a(cpu.o):
!                               in function `Board::Pic::Pic()':
! /.../repos/base-hw/src/core/spec/arm/virtualization/gicv2.h:22:
!     undefined reference to `Board::Pic::Gich::Gich()'

It turns out that the virtualization-related parts of the GICv2 driver reside
in a distinct compilation unit located at
_base-hw/src/core/spec/arm/virtualization/gicv2.cc_, which is not yet included
in the build description for core. We have to add the following line to
_allwinner/lib/mk/spec/arm_v8/core-hw-pine_a64lts.mk_.

! SRC_CC += spec/arm/virtualization/gicv2.cc

With these minor obstacles addressed, we get a system image that should
largely be compatible with our board. The urge to try out the freshly
baked system image on the board is strong. Why not?


A first life sign of the kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing the system image on the board comes down to the following few steps.

# Make sure to build the uImage using the 'image/uboot' RUN_OPT.

  ! $ RUN_OPT='--include image/uboot' make run/log BOARD=pine_a64lts KERNEL=hw

# Copy the uImage from _build/arm_v8a/var/run/log/uImage_ to the TFTP
  directory. In my case, that is _/var/lib/tftpboot/_.

# Boot the board and use U-Boot's 'bootp' and 'bootm' commands to load the
  uImage via TFTP and start it.

! => bootp 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/uImage

The excitement is real! That's the first life sign of Genode's kernel!
We get two satisfactory results at once.
First, our custom 'Ns16550_uart' driver is working, as evidenced by the
beautifully formatted error messages. So we did not mess up any of the
important numbers there.
Second, in contrast to the archaic experiments with the bare-metal serial
output, which did not even use a stack, we can now enjoy the comfort
of Genode's C++ runtime. We don't feel like living in a cave any longer.
