Pruning device trees
====================

We briefly touched the treasure trove called device trees in the
previous section. To leverage the
wealth of information for the development and porting of Genode device
drivers, this article introduces a handy new tool set.

As summarized in the previous article, device-tree files as found at
Linux source tree under _arch/<arch>/boot/dts/_ provide both
a structural description of an SoC and parametrization data for individual
device drivers. It goes without saying that this information is extremely
valuable. On the other hand, the encoding of the information in the form
of so-called _Devicetree Specification_
([https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/download/v0.3/devicetree-specification-v0.3.pdf - PDF])
files is not ideal for us.

The authors of DTS files anticipate a monolithic kernel where a global view of
the system is natural. In contrast, Genode fosters a strict separation of
drivers from each other where each driver gets to see only a tiny part of the
picture. With a DTS file of more than 1600 lines (as for the Pine-A64-LTS)
board given, it is really hard to see to see clear lines of responsibilities
between drivers. This is where Genode's tool at _tool/dts/extract_
comes into play. Just for reference, usage information are provided by
executing the tool without arguments.

Let's assume we have generated an all-encompassing DTS file
_flat_pine64lts.dts_ for our board via the C preprocessor as
described in Section [Device-tree treasure trove].

The _tool/dts/extract_ utility allows us to generate a dot graph from the
source, which can be processed by the [https://graphviz.org/ - Graphviz] dot
tool to generate a PNG file.

! tool/dts$ ./extract --dot-graph flat_pine64lts.dts > pine64.dot
! tool/dts$ dot -Tpng pine64.dot > pine64.png

[image pine64_dts]
  Does this count as generative art?

Even though the picture presents only a tiny fraction of the information
present in the DTS file - neither any properties, nor device addresses, nor
unlabeled nodes are shown - it is too overwhelming to be useful.

Let's say we are interested in the porting of the ethernet driver. In the
previous article we already manually walked the DTS tree and spotted the
corresponding node along the way. With the '--labels' option, the _extract_
tool provides a convenient way to get an overview of the nodes present in
the tree.

! tool/dts$ ./extract --labels flat_pine64lts.dts
! ...
! uart1 /soc/serial@1c28400
! spi0_pins /soc/pinctrl@1c20800/spi0-pins
! ve_sram /soc/syscon@1c00000/sram@1d00000/sram-section@0
! reg_aldo1 /soc/rsb@1f03400/pmic@3a3/regulators/aldo1
! emac /soc/ethernet@1c30000
! uart2 /soc/serial@1c28800
! lradc /soc/lradc@1c21800
! ...

Each line presents a label accompanied with the corresponding path of the
device node. Of course, the command is best combined with grep.

! tool/dts$ ./extract --labels flat_pine64lts.dts | grep ether
! emac /soc/ethernet@1c30000
! mdio /soc/ethernet@1c30000/mdio
! ext_rgmii_phy /soc/ethernet@1c30000/mdio/ethernet-phy@1

The 'emac' label should ring a bell from the previous article.
To find out about the interaction of the emac device with the other
parts of the device tree, the extract tool allows us to generate a
new DTS tree with only a selection of devices and their dependencies
present.

! tool/dts$ ./extract --select emac flat_pine64lts.dts > emac.dts

From the more of 1600 lines of the original DTS file, the result
comprises only about 200 lines. This amount of information can be
digested without choking.

! tool/dts$ wc -l emac.dts 
! 213 emac.dts
! tool/dts$ ./extract --dot-graph emac.dts > emac.dot
! tool/dts$ dot -Tpng emac.doc > emac.png

With a few final manual tweaks of the layout parameters, one can get a picture
as nice as this.

[image emac_dts]
  A sudden moment of clarity.

Finally, we can create a device-tree binary out of the pruned device-tree
source.

! tool/dts$ dtc -Idts emac.dts > emac.dtb

The device-tree compiler does not complain, which gives us the reassurance
that the tree is in a healthy state after the brutal pruning.


Test-driving Linux with the tuned device tree
---------------------------------------------

In order to successfully boot the Linux kernel, the supplied device tree
needs a few mandatory ingredients.
First, we need to supply the information about the timer to be used
by the kernel, which is provided by the '/timer' node.
Furthermore, '/chosen' node contains the
'stdout-path' property, which tells the kernel where messages should go.
In the device tree for the Pine-A64-LTS board, it is defined as
! stdout-path = "serial0:115200n8";
The 'serial0' part of the string refers to an entry of the '/aliases' node,
which is defines as follows. Note that it contains an alias referring to
our Ethernet device 'emac'.

! aliases {
!   ethernet0 = &emac;
!   serial0 = &uart0;
!   serial1 = &uart1;
!   serial2 = &uart2;
!   serial3 = &uart3;
!   serial4 = &uart4;
! };

The following command extracts a device tree featuring those mandatory nodes.
Since the 'emac' device is implicitly pulled in by the '/alias' node, we
don't need to explicitly specify the '--select emac' argument.

! tool/dts$ ./extract --select /chosen --select /aliases --select /timer \
!                     flat_pine64lts.dts

The resulting device tree, once compiled into its dtb representation, suffices
to boot the hand-crafted Linux kernel we built in the previous article. It
looks as follows.

[image emac_lx_dts]
  This fine-tuned device tree suffices for using Ethernet with Linux.

The '/timer', '/chosen', and '/aliases' nodes are not shown because the graph
omits unlabeled nodes. It still contains a few obviously unneeded parts such
as the ones relates to the 'simplefb' nodes (defined inside the '/chosen'
node) or the 'uart1' to 'uart4' nodes (referenced by the '/aliases' node). To
remove those, one may consider cutting off those dependencies by commenting
out those parts in the _flat_pine64lts.dts_ file.


Prospects
---------

Even though the primary motivation behind the new tooling is the pruning of
device trees to attain driver-specific miniature device trees to be fed to
ported Linux driver code, I already see myself using the graph feature as an
aid for understanding SoC hardware. As of now, the graph is admittedly just a
quick hack. The dot language allows for generating nicely structured images,
e.g., presenting child nodes contained in parent nodes. It's also tempting to
generate XML configuration data for Genode's platform driver from the
device-tree information.
