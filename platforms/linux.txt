Taking Linux out for a walk
===========================

In preparation of the porting of drivers from Linux to Genode, we have to
gather knowledge about the drivers' natural habitat. This article goes through
the steps of building a custom Linux system that is tailored to a driver of
our choice.

Most of Genode's device drivers are not written from scratch specifically for
Genode but ported from time-tested code bases such as the Linux kernel. In the
case of most ARM SoC drivers, the driver code is provided by the SoC vendors
and is often the only reference of how the hardware works. Given the
staggering complexity of the devices, their rapid product cycles, and the
diversity of employed IP cores, developing the drivers from scratch is out of
question.


Motivation
----------

In the past, we sometimes directly jumped into the driver-porting work guided
by mere intuition, transplanting chewable bites of Linux kernel code into
Genode components, and reanimating the code to life. In some cases like
our first port [1]
of the Intel GPU driver, we were lucky with bringing up a driver on Genode
without even testing the driver code on Linux beforehand. However, this
remained a rare exception. In most cases, especially when a predictable
success and development schedule is desired, we had to engage with the
building and integration of custom Linux systems as part of the driver-porting
work. Even though jumping thought the hoops of Linux is additional work, it
gives us three invaluable benefits.

[1] [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/10.08#Gallium3D_and_Intel_s_Graphics_Execution_Manager]

First, it gives us *reassurance* how the driver works on the reference
hardware. We can set our expectations regarding the feature set, stability,
and performance. Once the driver is ported, we can reflect on the success by
the means of benchmarking the driver in both systems Linux and Genode.

Second, it allows us to *study* and *instrument* the driver's interaction with
the user-level interfaces and the hardware. For getting hold of the userland's
interaction with the driver, it is useful to exercize the driver interfaces -
think of 'ioctl' calls - by walking the beaten tracks.

Third and most importantly, it allows for *cross-correlating* the behavior
of the driver in its natural environment against its execution within an
isolated Genode component. We have to mimick Linux kernel APIs so that the
driver is happy, after all. The comparison of the driver running in both
environments is instructive for crafting the driver environment.


Picking a tangible goal
-----------------------

Among the various classes of peripherals, _network_ devices are an attractive
target for porting a first driver.
In contrast to the PIO device discussed in
Section [One Platform driver to rule them all],
network devices are _complicated enough_ to get a tangible benefit out of
the porting approach. Conversely, network drivers are _simple enough_ to not
get overwhelmed.
Furthermore, network connectivity is _easy to test_ in an automated way,
avoiding distractions from fiddly manual workflows. Finally, the _reward_ of
enabling networking support is quite substantial. A single driver opens up a
whole world of Genode system scenarios.

In the following, we will walk towards a minimally complex custom Linux
system by taking the following steps.

* Learning how to use U-Boot to start an _arbitrary_ Linux-based OS,
* Using a custom initrd based on Busybox,
* Booting a _custom-built_ kernel,
* Getting the _network device_ to work,
* Stripping down the _kernel configuration_,
* Making the findings _reproducible_


Bootstrapping Linux using U-Boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our development work flow, we'd like to retain the convenience of network
boot as explored in Sections [Getting acquainted with the target platform] and
[Bare-metal serial output].
Booting Linux differs from booting a single binary as we did so far. For
grokking those differences, it is nice to rely on known-to-work ingredients.

Remembering from Section [Getting acquainted with the target platform]
how well the image of the Armbian [1] distribution worked on the board,
we know where to look. There are various ways for accessing the content
of the image. When using Gnome, you may be able to mount the image by clicking
on it. In my case, I loop-mounted the image manually. First, looking in the
partition table to find out where the file system starts.

[1] [https://www.armbian.com]

! $ fdisk -l Armbian_21.05....img
! Disk Armbian_21.05....img: 1,7 GiB, 1782579200 bytes, 3481600 sectors
! ...
! Armbian_21.05....img1  8192 3481599 3473408  1,7G 83 Linux

It starts at block '8192'. Given the usual block size of 512 and the help of a
multiplication device, we get to know the byte offset as an argument for
loop-mounting the file system.

! $ python -c "print 8192*512"
! 4194304
! $ sudo mount -oloop,offset=4194304 Armbian_21.05....img /mnt

In the file-system's _/boot/_ directory, the files of interest are:

:Image: is a symlink to the Linux kernel.
  In my case, it refers to _vmlinuz-5.10.34-sunxi64_, which is a file of
  21 MiB.

:config-5.10.34-sunxi64: is the kernel configuration, which will become
  handy once we build the kernel from source. Save it for later.

:dtb/allwinner/: is a directory of so-called device-tree files, which we
  will cover in a minute. For now, it suffices to know that each dtb file
  contains a hardware description of a specific board. Among the 48 dtb
  files present in the directory, I identified the one for the Pine-A64-LTS
  board via
  ! $ ls -1 /mnt/boot/dtb/allwinner/ | grep a64 | grep lts
  ! sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb

:initrd.img-5.10.34-sunxi64: is the initial ram disk used for bootstrapping
  the userland.

For booting Linux, we have to supply the kernel (Image), the dtb file
(pine64.dtb) for our board, and the initrd via our TFTP directory and can use
the following U-Boot commands to bring the combination of the pieces to life.
The addresses are picked such that they do not overlap, using U-Boot's default
load address for the kernel.

# Load the kernel.
  ! => bootp 0x42000000 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/Image

# Load the initial RAM disk.
  ! => bootp 0x41000000 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/initrd

# Load the device-tree file
  ! => bootp 0x41f00000 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/pine64.dtb

# Modifying the device tree to supply kernel parameters.
  First, telling U-Boot's FDT tool where the location of our DTB data.
  ! => fdt addr 0x41f00000
  Making space for adding additional content.
  ! => fdt resize 0x1000
  Modifying the 'chosen' device-tree node that contains the kernel parameters
  such as the location of the initrd (start and end address)
  ! => fdt chosen 0x41000000 0x41996388
  or the kernel command line
  ! => fdt set /chosen bootargs "rdinit=/bin/sh"

# Start the kernel by specifying the kernel's address and DTB address.
  We can specify '-' as the second (initrd) argument because we already
  tell the kernel the location of the initrd via the 'chosen' DTB node.
  ! => booti 0x42000000 - 0x41f00000

It goes without saying that manually executing this sequence of
commands would be error-prone and unnerving. Fortunately, U-Boot allows
us to store a sequence of commands in an environment variable, like so:

! => setenv lx 'command; another command; ...'

The variable named 'lx' now contains the sequence of the  commands separated by
semicolons.
The value of 'lx' variable can be made persistent via the mechanism discussed
in Section [The U-Boot boot loader].
! => saveenv

The sequence of commands stored in the variable 'lx' can be executed via the
'run' command:
! => run lx

The machinery takes over...

A custom initrd based on Busybox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the clarity gained about the network boot process of Linux via U-Boot,
we can now stepwise replace each of the three ingredients.

First, we replace Armbian's initrd with a custom-built RAM disk based on
Busybox [1]. This will give us a functional,
reproducible, and customizable userland to play with while being ten times
smaller than the initrd we scraped off the Armbian image. Since we ultimately
strive for a minimalistic Linux kernel with all batteries for our board
included and dynamic modules switched off, we don't need the initrd as a
carrier of kernel modules after all.

[1] [https://www.busybox.net/]

Presuming that a regular ARM tool chain and the cpio utilities are installed
(e.g., the Debian packages _gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu_ and _cpio_), the following
steps produce a custom initrd from scratch.

# Download and extract BusyBox

  ! $ wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.29.3.tar.bz2
  !
  ! $ tar xjf busybox-1.29.3.tar.bz2
  ! $ mkdir build-busybox-aarch64
  ! $ cd busybox-1.29.3

# Configure BusyBox
  ! $ make O=../build-busybox-aarch64 defconfig
  ! $ make O=../build-busybox-aarch64 menuconfig

  Check the following setting in the menu:
  ! [*] Setting ->  Build static binary (no shared libs)

# Compile BusyBox with the installed cross-compile tool chain

  ! $ cd ../build-busybox-aarch64
  ! $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- install -j6

# Useful setups for the ram disk

  ! $ cd <busbox-build-dir>/_install

  Create fstab by editing _etc/fstab_ as follows.

  ! none /proc  proc   defaults 0 0
  ! none /sys   sysfs  defaults 0 0

  Enable DNS resolution via a predefined name server.

  ! $ echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" > etc/resolv.conf

  Create a run-level script using mdev by creating a _etc/init.d/rcS_
  file with the following content.

  ! #/bin/sh
  !
  ! mkdir -p /proc
  ! mkdir -p /sys
  ! mkdir -p /var/shm
  ! mkdir -p /var/run
  ! mkdir -p /var/tmp
  ! mkdir -p /tmp
  ! mkdir -p /home/tc
  ! mkdir -p /root
  ! mkdir -p /dev
  !
  ! /bin/mount -t tmpfs mdev /dev
  ! mkdir /dev/pts
  ! /bin/mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts
  !
  ! echo "Mount everything ${1}"
  ! /bin/mount -a
  !
  ! echo /sbin/mdev > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
  ! /sbin/mdev -s
  ! echo "Finished"
  ! /bin/sh

# Create the initial ram disk using _cpio_

  ! $ find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip > ../initrd


After replacing Armbian's initrd with our custom initrd in the TFTP directory,
the U-Boot command for tweaking the 'chosen' device-tree node must be slightly
adjusted to the different size.


Vendor kernel source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most SoCs, the chip vendor provides a vendor-blessed version of the
Linux kernel source somewhere on the internet. Those so-called vendor
kernels are usually a somewhat sour compromise. On the one hand, they contain the
know-how of the vendor regarding the device drivers. The vendor kernels are
usually tailored well to the hardware. On the other hand, the "tailoring" does
not always follow the written and unwritten rules of Linux kernel development,
standing in the way of cleanly integrating the vendor code into the upstream
kernel. Some vendors don't even try. Hence, after the vendor kernel for a
specific chip is publicly released, it must be assumed a dead branch of kernel
development, receiving no further love. In our situation - where we are after
the vendor's drivers - we have to take the SoC's vendor kernel as our
reference.

In the case of the Allwinner A64 SoC, the
vendor kernel [1] is based on Linux as old
as version 3.10. However, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Sunxi [2]
open-source community that works
independently from the SoC vendor, the A64 is fully supported by the upstream
Linux kernel by now.
The instructions [3] for building
a kernel suitable for the A64 SoC come down to compiling the Linux kernel for
the AARCH64 architecture using its default configuration.

[1] [https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64#BSP]

[2] [https://linux-sunxi.org]

[3] [https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64#Linux_Kernel]

The bottom line is that we can pick a recent kernel from
[https://kernel.org] and go with it.

! $ wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz
! ...
! $ tar xf linux-5.12.1.tar.xz

This will extract the kernel source to the _linux-5.12.1_ subdirectory.
In the following, we will refer to this directory as LX_DIR. Let's remember
the path in a environment variable. That's just for convenience.

! export LX_DIR=$PWD/linux-5.12.1


Building and booting a custom-built kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's give the default kernel configuration a try. For hygienic reasons,
I prefer using a build directory separate from the source tree. Let's call
the build directory LX_BUILD_DIR pointing at some place that does not exist
yet.

! export LX_BUILD_DIR=$PWD/lx_build

When using the Linux build system targeting the AARCH64 architecture,
one always has to specify 'ARCH=arm64' as argument to make. Note that this
argument even changes the output of 'make help'. So we should apply it
consistently. Let's stuff it into an environment variable so that we don't
need to repeat it over and over again.

! export ARCH=arm64

Similarly to the 'ARCH' argument, we need to tell the kernel's build system
about the tool chain used for cross compiling the kernel. In our case,
we want to use Genode's tool chain, which is usually installed at
_/usr/local/genode/tool/<version>/bin/_ and prefixed with 'genode-aarch64-'.
The kernel's build system expects this information as CROSS_COMPILE argument
or environment variable.

! export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/genode/tool/21.05/bin/genode-aarch64-

With these precautions taken, we can initialize the build directory
with the default configuration via

! make -C $LX_DIR O=$LX_BUILD_DIR defconfig

The kernel configuration can be found at the .config file inside the build
directory. To get an idea what a "default" configuration entails, the number
of enabled options is telling.

! $ grep =y $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config | wc -l
! 2482

I translate this number to _not processable by my mind_.

A further feel of defeat sets in when trying to compare the default
configuration with the _config-5.10.21-sunxi64_ found on the Armbian image.

! $ diff $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config config-5.10.21-sunxi64 | wc -l
! 10363

We seem to be out of luck if we think of correlating both configurations with
each other.

Without further ado, the kernel image can be built as follows.

! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR Image -j8
!   ...
!
!   LD      vmlinux
!   SORTTAB vmlinux
!   SYSMAP  System.map
!   OBJCOPY arch/arm64/boot/Image

On my laptop, this takes about 20 minutes. As indicated by the build-system
messages, the resulting kernel 'Image' can
be found at the _arch/arm64/boot/_. It has a size of 32 MiB.

By the way, the kernel's build system offers a number of other useful targets
such as a compressed kernel image. It is worth taking a look at the options.

! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR help

Here, we can learn that there exists a convenient target for creating DTB
files.

! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR dtbs

So we can pick the dtb file matching our board from _arch/arm64/boot/dts/_,
in our case _allwinner/sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb_ replacing the third
magical puzzle piece of the boot process by a variant created from source.

When trying out the fresh baked kernel on the board, we can see the kernel
booting up, showing the kernel log over the serial line, and presenting
us with the root shell. We have a solid ground to walk on!

Next up, let us turn our attention to networking. The first impulse is to
issue 'ifconfig' to see the presence of network devices. Well, the bad news
is that there are none.

We can look at this problem from several angles.

* Grep'ing the _.config_ file for patterns like ALLWINNER, SUNXI, NET, etc.
* Wandering through the menus of 'make menuconfig' on the hunt for cues.
* Comparing the boot logs of the Armbian kernel and the custom built kernel,
  looking out for network-related messages.

Of these points, the last one is probably the least futile. However, there
is an alternative route towards success and happiness: Let's have a closer
look at the device tree for our board.


Device-tree treasure trove
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The so-called device trees [1]
are semi-formal descriptions of a hardware platforms, which may consist of
several peripherals, buses, interrupt controllers, clocks, and so on.
In the context of Linux, it serves two purposes. First, it fills the gap of
dynamic device discovery on platforms where devices cannot
be probed in a reliable way at runtime. This applies for most ARM SoCs.
By looking at the device tree, the kernel learns which drivers are to use.
Second, the device tree parametrizes the individual drivers. This allows
drivers to stay clear from vendor-specific parameters hard-coded in the
source code. By taking parameters from the device tree, drivers can more
easily re-targeted to other SoC revisions.

[1] [https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/]

For our aspiration to port drivers to Genode, device trees are a blessing.
Since they are curated by the SoC vendors, they contain a form of hardware
documentation that can often not be found anywhere else. Moreover, in
contrast to sketchy documentation - if available at all - the information
present in the device trees can be assumed to be correct because it plays a
role in driving the hardware. In a way, device trees look like a social
engineering trick to wrest hardware docs from vendors. To lift the
treasure, we have to look in the source tree at _arch/arm64/boot/dts/_.

! $ find $LX_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts

We find almost 800 files there. But the forest is well organized. It is
straight-forward to spot the vendor and narrow the search. In my case:

! $ find $LX_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts | grep allwinner
! ...
! $ find $LX_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts | grep allwinner | grep pine
! ...
! $ find $LX_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts | grep allwinner | grep pine | grep lts
! .../arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dts

When looking into this file, we see that it uses the C preprocessor to
include a bunch of includes. To get the entire picture, we have to apply
the C-preprocessing step.

! $ cpp -I $LX_DIR/include -x assembler-with-cpp -P \
!       $LX_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dts \
!       > flat_pine64lts.dts

The '-x assembler-with-cpp' argument is needed to prevent the C preprocessor
from misinterpreting lines with a leading '#' as preprocessor directive.
The '-P' argument removes line markers from the output. It is useful to
save the result in a file (_flat_pine64lts.dts_), which we can consult
at any time later. For the Pine-A64-LTS board, the file comprises 1600 lines of
insights: the relationships of many important numbers to human-readable
terminology.


Enabling network support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refreshed from studying the device tree for our board, now is a good time to
come back to the topic of enabling the networking for our board. By skimming
over the flattened dts file, the following node featuring the term "ethernet"
catches our attention.

! emac: ethernet@1c30000 {
!  compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac";
!  syscon = <&syscon>;
!  reg = <0x01c30000 0x10000>;
!  interrupts = <0 82 4>;
!  interrupt-names = "macirq";
!  resets = <&ccu 13>;
!  reset-names = "stmmaceth";
!  clocks = <&ccu 36>;
!  clock-names = "stmmaceth";
!  status = "disabled";
!  mdio: mdio {
!   compatible = "snps,dwmac-mdio";
!   #address-cells = <1>;
!   #size-cells = <0>;
!  };
! };

Let me draw your attention to the two lines defining a property called
'compatible'. Those properties denote the driver that should be used to talk
to this piece of hardware. It actually draws a direct connection to the source
code. To put the device-tree node in other words:

_To use ethernet on our board, the kernel configuration must include the_
_source code related to "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac" and "snps,dwmac-mdio"_.

Let's start with "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac".

! $ grep -r "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac" $LX_DIR/drivers/net
! .../stmmac/dwmac-sun8i.c: { .compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac",

Apparently, a sledgehammer is sometimes the perfect device for singling out a
needle from a haystack.
Let's not waste too much time with looking at the code. The only information
important to us is the name of the compilation unit 'dwmac-sun8i.c'.
As a matter of convention, the corresponding object file is usually present
in the makefile for the subsystem.

! $ grep "dwmac-sun8i.o" $LX_DIR/drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/Makefile
! obj-$(CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I)	+= dwmac-sun8i.o

What a revelation! We have just drawn the connection from a node found it
a device tree to a kernel-configuration option. When looking at the
kernel's '.config' file, it becomes clear that the kernel does not drive
the ethernet device with builtin drivers because the driver is configured
as a module.

! $ grep CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config
! CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I=m

Often, kernel options have dependencies. To get a picture of the dependencies
of the 'CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I' driver, one can consult the accompanied _Kconfig_
files or show the 'Help' for the corresponding item in the menus of the
kernel's 'make menuconfig' interactive configuration tool.

! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR menuconfig

Use search ('/') to search for the desired option (e.g., CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I),
learn about the location of the option in the menu hierarchy, and look out
for dependencies not marked with 'y'. In our concrete case, the two
options STMMAC_ETH and STMMAC_PLATFORM must be enabled to satisfy DWMAC_SUN8I.

To enable the options, one may use the interactive menu config tool. But
I prefer a non-interactive way that can be scripted. There exists a handy tool
at _scripts/config_ in the kernel source tree that allows us to enable and
disable options, like so:

! $ $LX_DIR/scripts/config --file $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config \
!        --enable STMMAC_ETH --enable STMMAC_PLATFORM --enable DWMAC_SUN8I

The tool merely sets or removes individual options. It must be followed
by an invocation of 'make olddefconfig' to resolve possible inconsistencies
and dependencies.

! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR olddefconfig

By looking at the resulting '.config' we get the reassurance that all
dependencies are indeed met.

! $ grep CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config
! CONFIG_DWMAC_SUN8I=y

The steps above may appear long-winded. But in contrast to hit-and-miss
juggling of kernel configurations, the steps form a deterministic and
explainable process.

With the driver for the "allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac" device-tree node
covered, we are left to repeat the process for the "snps,dwmac-mdio" node.
It turns out this node is covered by STMMAC_PLATFORM already.

As a convenient way to quickly test-drive our network-equipped Linux kernel,
the kernel can be instructed to issue a DHCP request as part of the boot
process. This can be enabled by specifying the argument 'ip=dhcp' to the
kernel command line. For reference, when using U-Boot's 'fdt' command,
the 'chosen' device-tree node can be adjusted as follows:

! => fdt set /chosen bootargs "rdinit=/bin/sh ip=dhcp"

Once all driver dependencies are resolved, 'ifconfig' reports the
Ethernet device with its IP address. At this point we know that network
packets were successfully transmitted in both directions.

! / # ifconfig
! ifconfig: /proc/net/dev: No such file or directory
! eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:BA:FE:7B:59:38  
!           inet addr:10.0.0.178  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

Stripping down the kernel configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though the custom built kernel works in principle, the situation
it not satisfactory. First, the kernel image of 32 MiB carries a lot
of excess weight when considering that we merely want to take the network
driver for a joyride. Second, we learned that the default configuration
deliberately excludes features that we deem interesting.

To overcome this situation, we have to dive into the world of Linux kernel
configuration more than knee deep. But first, let's backup the known-to-work
'.config' file.

! cp $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config $LX_BUILD_DIR/config_works

In addition to the 'defconfig' build target that results in 2482 options
enabled in the '.config' file, the kernel's build system also features
a 'tinyconfig' target that leaves only 323 options enabled.
By using this configuration, the 'Image' build time goes down from 20
minutes to only 1.5 minutes with the image weighting only 1.6 MiB. That
is much more to my taste!

The only downside of the 'tiny' kernel is that it does not show a life
sign when booted on our board. But that is expected because the configuration
does not accommodate any specific SoC out of the box. In order to bring it to
life, all we need to do is to enable the right options, don't we?
The first goal should be to find the options needed to get the boot log over
the serial line. Once we accomplish that, we can turn our attention to
supporting our initrd. Once that works, we can revive the networking support.

At this point, we know that serial output works with the 'defconfig' kernel.
The 2482 options enabled for the defconfig have to contain the right ones.
Most obviously, we need to enable the platform support for our SoC
(ARCH_SUNXI).
We can let our intuition guide us for a bit. Which kernel options found in the
defconfig could possibly contribute to serial output of the kernel console?
Searching the _config_works_ file for terms like "SERIAL".
! $ grep =y $LX_BUILD_DIR/config_works | grep SERIAL
! ...
E.g., SERIAL_EARLYCON looks certainly useful to have.

The second strategy for finding the right options is the device-tree-driven
approach we used for the network device. Searching the DTS file for "serial"
leads us to a node referring to "snps,dw-apb-uart", which relates to
_8250_dw.c_ and _8250_early.c_, which in turn brings CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DW
and CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE to our attention. Fast forward, the following
options can be directly inferred from the device tree:
SERIAL_8250, SERIAL_8250_16550A_VARIANTS, SERIAL_8250_DW, SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE.

Looking from above, looking from below, however we look, there is still a
gap of config options to fill. To uncover the missing options, we can apply
brute force, bisecting the configurations as illustrated by the following commands:

# Create a fresh tinyconfig
  ! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR tinyconfig

# Enable options we already know we need for sure
  ! $ $LX_DIR/scripts/config --file $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config \
  !    --enable SERIAL_8250 ...

# Enable half of the candidates found in the backed up defconfig
  ! $ grep =y $LX_BUILD_DIR/config_works |\
  !    head -n 1200 |\
  !    sed "s/=y//" |\
  !    xargs -ixxx $LX_DIR/scripts/config \
  !                    --file $LX_BUILD_DIR/.config --enable xxx

  This command adjusts the _.config_ file by enabling the first 1200 config
  options we find enabled in the _config_works_ file, which are the upper half
  of the enabled options.

# Sanitize the _.config_ file
  ! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR olddefconfig

# Build the kernel and copy the resulting image the TFTP directory
  ! $ make -C $LX_BUILD_DIR dtbs Image -j8 \
  !   && cp $LX_BUILD_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/Image /var/lib/tftpboot/

# Boot the board. If the kernel shows a life sign over serial, we know
  that all the needed options are covered by the first 1200 ones.
  Otherwise, we know that a missing option is somewhere beyond those 1200.
  So we can continue with the first step while cutting the search space
  in half for each iteration.

For example, in the case of the Pine-A64-LTS board, I found that the first
1200 options sufficed for the serial output. So I went for the first 600
options in the next iteration.

Since the search space is cut into half in each iteration, resolving the
mystery of missing kernel options comes down to about 10 iterations and a bit
of patience. Using this process, I uncovered the need for CONFIG_PRINTK,
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF, or BLK_DEV_INITRD, which look obvious in hindsight but
are very unlikely to find by the means of grep, intuition, or device-tree
analysis.

By following this process, I eventually came up with a kernel has networking
and serial output enabled. The bisecting work is not taxing but rather
mechanic. It is nice knowing that it leads to predictable success. With about
500 options enabled and an image size of 4.2 MiB (uncompressed), the resulting
kernel is a workable basis for the upcoming porting and instrumentation work.


Making the findings reproducible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with any Genode-related working topic, I'm trying to make the essence
of the above findings easily reproducible, for others and me. This way,
the next developer can pick up a topic where I left it.

To download the kernel using Genode's ports tool, we can start with the
following initial ports file placed at _allwinner/ports/a64_linux.port_.
The prefix 'a64' refers to the name of the Allwinner SoC, which expresses
our intent that the downloaded version of the Linux kernel is blessed for
the use of this particular SoC.

! LICENSE   := GPLv2
! VERSION   := 5.12.1
! DOWNLOADS := a64_linux.archive
!
! URL(a64_linux) := https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-$(VERSION).tar.xz
! SHA(a64_linux) := 123
! DIR(a64_linux) := src/linux

The SHA hash is not known at this point, just putting an arbitrary number 123
there. The accompanied _allwinner/ports/a64_linux.hash_ hash file can be
created with a made-up number.

! 456

With the port-description file and hash file in place, we can give the
'a64_linux' port a try.

! genode$ ./tool/ports/prepare_port a64_linux
! a64_linux  download https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz
! Error: Hash sum check for a64_linux failed

Even though the hash-sum check predictably failed, the download of the archive
succeeded. It can be found in the _genode/contrib/_ directory in a
subdirectory named after the port file.

! genode$ ls -lh contrib/a64_linux-456.incomplete/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz
! ... 113M ... contrib/a64_linux-456.incomplete/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz

The correct SHA hash value is just one invocation of 'sha256sum' away:

! genode$ sha256sum contrib/a64_linux-456.incomplete/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz 
! c0fc1cf...fe5f37  contrib/a64_linux-456.incomplete/linux-5.12.1.tar.xz

Now we can replace the dummy value 123 in the port description file with the
correct value and retry the 'prepare_port' call.

! genode$ ./tool/ports/prepare_port a64_linux
! a64_linux  extract linux-5.12.1.tar.xz (a64_linux)
! a64_linux  generate a64_linux.hash
! Error: allwinner/ports/a64_linux.port is out of date, expected 155f...

This time, the extraction step succeeded. However, the port tool rightfully
argues about the port hash, which is a hash over the port description file.
The hash ensures that port is consistent with the Genode source tree.
This can be conveniently updated using the
ports/update_hash tool.

! genode$ ./tool/ports/update_hash a64_linux
! generate a64_linux.hash

With the hash updated, the next attempt to 'prepare_port' succeeds:

! genode$ ./tool/ports/prepare_port a64_linux
! a64_linux  extract linux-5.12.1.tar.xz (a64_linux)
! a64_linux  generate a64_linux.hash
! genode$ ls contrib/a64_linux-155f8b01cd911f42f23178571d70a2220612b634/
! a64_linux.hash  linux-5.12.1.tar.xz  src

The _src/linux/_ subdirectory contains the source tree of the kernel.

! genode$ ls contrib/a64_linux-155f8b01cd911f42f23178571d70a2220612b634/src/linux/
! arch     CREDITS        fs       Kbuild   LICENSES     net      security  virt
! block    crypto         include  Kconfig  MAINTAINERS  README   sound
! certs    Documentation  init     kernel   Makefile     samples  tools
! COPYING  drivers        ipc      lib      mm           scripts  usr

Finally, to conserve the information about configuring and building a Linux
kernel tailored to our porting work, I added a Genode build target at
_allwinner/src/a64_linux/target.mk_ [1],
which applies the kernel configuration and builds the kernel image.
Thanks to this _target.mk_ file, the custom Linux kernel can be built
from within Genode's build directory via:
