Porting Genode to a new SoC
###########################

We get repeatedly asked about the principle steps and costs needed to enable
Genode - and in particular Sculpt OS [1] - for various ARM-based hardware
platforms. The variety of SoCs is too great to give a general answer. However,
drawing from our experience with the porting Genode to several ARM-based
platforms such as NXP's i.MX8, this chapter provides a practical guide for the
steps of such a porting endeavour.

The guide is based on an article series at [https://genodians.org]. It is
written in an informal style from the perspective of a developer carrying
out the work, taking a specific board - namely the Pine-A64-LTS single
board computer - as a playground. The code discussed throughout this
chapter is available at the following public Git repository.

The guide is not carved in stone. It will be progressively enhanced with
further information - e.g., details about various classes of drivers - over
time. Should you happen find important topics missing or spot mistakes or have
suggestions for improving the material, please don't hesitate to send your
feedback to _norman.feske@genode-labs.com_.


Goals
-----

Our goal would be to get the bare-bones Sculpt system up and running on an ARM
SoC not yet supported by Genode. This bare-bones Sculpt system entails

* The principal ability for the user to interact with the system via
  a graphical user interface,

* Support for installing and deploying the existing arsenal of Genode
  components from regular packages,

* The ability to store information persistently on the device, and

* Network connectivity.

Thanks to Sculpt's built-in ability to integrate 3rd-party components -
including functionality that is traditionally attributed to the core of the
operating system - into the system in the form of packages, this bare-bones
system enables a great variety of usage scenarios.

Non-goals
---------

That said, the following features remain beyond the scope of this document
because they are either too vendor-specific to be described in a general
fashion or can be realized in the form of supplemental components.

* Hardware-accelerated graphics,

* Audio,

* Power management,

* Mobile data communication,

* Secure boot.


Working steps
-------------

The work of enabling Genode for a new SoC requires the following steps in the
described order. To give an indicator of the effort to be expected, each step
is accompanied with a rough estimation.

# Preparing the development testbed

  Before the actual development work can start, a few preparations are needed
  or at least recommended.

  One of our team members typically spends up to *one month* for this step.

  * Building and running a working Linux-based OS on the target board as
    reference, following the instructions of the vendor

  * Exploration and configuration of the target's boot mechanism

  * Creation of a test-control loop for triggering the booting the target board
    via the run tool, serving the boot image over the local network, and
    obtaining the log output.

  * Familiarization with the available board and SoC-vendor documentation
    and the Vendor-specific subsystems in the vendor's Linux kernel

  * Studying the device tree, correlating it with information gathered
    from the documentation.

# Code skeleton for a new SoC

  Given the impressions gathered during the preparatory step, we take one
  of the SoCs that are already supported by Genode as reference. One should
  select the SoC with the most similarities such as the same ARM core revision
  or the same interrupt controller. The goal of this step is an almost
  empty skeleton code of Genode that gives us a little life sign when booted
  on the real hardware.

  It does not take a seasoned Genode developer longer than *two weeks* to
  complete this step. However, for a developer with no prior experience with
  Genode's code base, an *additional* effort of *two weeks* for the required
  familiarization should be planned for.

  * Mirroring the files of another SoC but with empty bodies,
    (describing roles of the individual files)
  * Creating a bare-bone base-hw kernel ELF image
  * Booting the custom image on the target hardware
  * Serial output driver

# Basic kernel functionality

  The goal of this step is getting the most basic Genode system scenario
  to run on the new SoC. This scenario comprises three components, namely
  the Genode core component (including the kernel), the init component,
  and a test program that produces some log output.

  On this way, one has to overcome the challenges of initializing the kernel,
  enabling the MMU, and exercising the kernel's IPC and context-switching
  mechanism. Assuming that the new SoC has the same architecture revision
  as the ones already supported by Genode, this step should take no longer
  than *two weeks*.

  * Enabling the MMU
  * Enabling caches
  * Memory layout parameters
  * Entering and returning from the user land (IPC, context switches)
  * Running Genode's log scenario

# Support for user-level device drivers

  With the principal ability of running multiple user-level components,
  it is time to enable preemptive scheduling and the kernel mechanisms
  needed by user-level device drivers. Assuming the new SoC uses standard
  ARM building blocks like the core-local timer and the GIC interrupt
  controller as readily supported by Genode, this step does not entail
  much risks and should be completed within *a week*.

  However, should the SoC deviate from the beaten track of standard ARM
  building blocks, e.g., using a custom interrupt controller, the step may
  additionally require the development of an in-kernel driver for such a
  device. Genode provides several existing drivers that can be taken as a blue
  print. Depending of the quirkiness of the device, the development can take
  one or two weeks. Fortunately, vendor-specific timers and interrupt
  controllers are largely a problem of the past.

  * Enabling the in-kernel interrupt controller driver
  * Enabling in-kernel timer driver
  * Definition of I/O resources
  * IOMUX configuration (board-specific)

  Once the principal support for user-level device drivers is in place,
  the development work can be tackled by multiple developers in parallel.

# Network driver

  We usually plan to spend about *one month* for enabling a network driver
  for Genode. Depending on the complexity of the network controller,
  the driver may be ported from the Linux kernel, from the U-Boot boot
  loader, or written from scratch.

# SD-card driver

  For driving SD-cards, we usually extend Genode's custom SD-card driver
  with SoC-specific support, which takes usually *two weeks*. One should
  be prepared for device-specific peculiarities though. In some cases,
  in the presence of flaky hardware, it took us up to 3 weeks more to reach
  a stable and performant state.

# Framebuffer driver

  In the past, we used to develop framebuffer drivers from scratch. But
  nowadays, we prefer to reuse the vendor-provided driver code from the Linux
  kernel to attain feature parity with Linux. That said, depending on the
  driver, such porting work still requires substantial manual labour because
  the driver often does not only drive one device but multiple (such as
  power-gating via additional I2C-connected controllers, or a dedicated HDMI
  chip). As an indicator for the expected effort, the i.MX framebuffer driver
  took us *two months* to bring to life.

# USB host-controller driver

  Genode's USB host-controller driver is based on the Linux USB driver.
  Adding supplemental support for a new SoC should generally possible within
  *one month*. With the USB host-controller driver in place, the actual USB
  device drivers (e.g., for HID and storage) should work out of the box.

  As a note of caution, in rare cases, in particular for the Raspberry Pi, the
  USB host controller driver can become an almost infinite time sink though.

# Multi-processor support

  Real-world workloads demand multi-processor support. In theory, this should
  generally be covered well by Genode's ARM support as long as the SoC stays
  close to ARM's reference design. However, the bring-up of secondary CPUs,
  inter-processor interrupts, and the maintenance of TLB/cache coherence still
  poses risks because those topics may involve upcalls to vendor-specific
  firmware or may depend on the unexpected vendor-specific boot-time
  configuration (like the surprise of one CPU core left configured with a
  different byte order). To stay on the safe side, one should plan *one month*
  for the potential troubleshooting around these areas.

# Sculpt OS integration

  With the four peripheral drivers in place, Sculpt's demands on the platform's
  feature set is satisfied. The remaining task is the integration of those
  drivers into Sculpt, which should be doable in no more than *two weeks*.

  * Drivers subsystem definition
  * Sculpt-manager tweaks
  * Configuration

Summary
-------

Based on the steps outlined above, the effort seems to be modest but - given a
healthy dose of enthusiasm - quite doable for an individual or a small team.
The biggest risk is the incomplete or lacking documentation for most ARM SoCs.

Granted, such a bare-bone system is still a far cry from a sophisticated
product like a smart phone, which features plenty of additional peripheral
devices, an aggressive power-management regime, GPU-accelerated rendering, or
Bluetooth. But once a bare-bones Sculpt system is ready to run, further device
drivers can be developed as regular components independent from each other,
which is the beauty of a component-based operating system like Sculpt OS.
