Bare-metal serial output
========================

In the previous section,
we started getting acquainted with the Pine64 hardware, established a serial
connection using Linux, and explored the use of the U-Boot boot loader.
Now we can move towards running Genode's kernel on the device. Before
touching Genode, however, we need to take two precautions.

# We need to understand the hand-over of execution from the boot loader to the
  loaded kernel code.

# In order to know that the right things are happening within our custom
  code, we need a way to get information out.

To address both questions, we are going to build a custom code blob that can
be copied to a predefined physical-memory address and, when executed, prints
characters over the serial line.
For the latter, we need a primitive way to print debug messages over a serial
connection. This section goes through the steps of executing custom code on
bare-metal hardware with no kernel underneath, and attaining serial output by
poking UART device registers directly.


Information gathering
---------------------

During our initial exploration in Section
[Getting acquainted with the target platform], we stumbled over a serial device 
of type "16550A" at address 0x1c28000 that is apparently used by the Linux kernel by
default. We have already seen it in action when we interacted with U-Boot and
the Armbian system over the serial connection. Just for reference, here is
the corresponding 'dmesg' output again:

! [    2.250163] 1c28000.serial: ttyS0 at MMIO 0x1c28000
!                (irq = 31, base_baud = 1500000) is a 16550A

There are several ways to find out more about this particular device.
For example, one might be inclined to consult chip-vendor documentation. This,
however, can be a muddy approach. More often than not, ARM-based SoCs are
poorly covered by public documentation, or the available documentation
contains uncertainties or even errors. Whenever feasible, I like to follow the
path of ground truth, looking at known-to-work code as reference.
Let's examine the build configuration of our build of U-Boot, which can
be readily found in the _u-boot/.config_ file. When searching it for the string
"Serial", we quickly end up at the following line:

! CONFIG_SYS_NS16550=y

The driver has to have something like "NS16550" in its name. So let's grep
the source tree for files named after this string:

! $ cd u-boot
! $ find | grep -i NS16550
! ./drivers/serial/ns16550.c
! ./drivers/serial/ns16550.su
! ./drivers/serial/.ns16550.o.cmd
! ./drivers/serial/ns16550.o
! ./drivers/serial/serial_ns16550.c
! ./include/ns16550.h
! ./include/config/sys/ns16550.h
! ./spl/drivers/serial/ns16550.su
! ./spl/drivers/serial/serial_ns16550.o
! ./spl/drivers/serial/.ns16550.o.cmd
! ./spl/drivers/serial/ns16550.o
! ./spl/drivers/serial/serial_ns16550.su
! ./spl/drivers/serial/.serial_ns16550.o.cmd

That looks promising. At this point, we are especially interested in drawing
the connection to the UART device address 0x1c28000. Remember how we specified
'PLAT=sun50i_a64' to the build system of U-Boot? The "sun50i_a64" has to refer
to our SoC. So let's grep the source tree for any connection between "sun" and
"NS16550".

! grep -r NS16550 | grep -i sun
! ...
! include/configs/sunxi-common.h:# define CONFIG_SYS_NS16550_COM1  SUNXI_UART0_BASE
! include/configs/sunxi-common.h:# define CONFIG_SYS_NS16550_COM2  SUNXI_UART1_BASE
! ...

Next stop, SUNXI_UART0_BASE:

! grep -r SUNXI_UART0_BASE
! ...
! arch/arm/include/asm/arch-sunxi/cpu_sun9i.h:#define SUNXI_UART0_BASE (REGS_APB1_BASE + 0x0000)
! arch/arm/include/asm/arch-sunxi/cpu_sun4i.h:#define SUNXI_UART0_BASE 0x01c28000
! ...

Now seeing the address 0x01c28000, we know for certain that we are looking at
the right device and the corresponding driver code.

The next step consists of cross-checking several pieces of information.
Searching the web for "NS16550 pdf" brings up the data sheet for the
device ([http://caro.su/msx/ocm_de1/16550.pdf]). In contrast to SoC
chip vendor documentation, data sheets of individual IP cores like this are -
if publicly available - usually of good quality. So we are lucky.
Glimpsing over the data sheet, we learn that the register at offset 0 is
the so-called transmitter holding register (THR). We must write to this
register to print a character.
It is interesting to see that all device registers are 8 bits wide.
This raises the question how those registers are mapped to system-bus
addresses of the ARM SoC. The answer can be found at the
Allwinner A64 manual [1] as linked by the Pine64 wiki.
Here, we learn that the individual registers are mapped to 32-bit aligned
memory-mapped I/O registers.
Thus, the register offsets found in the NS16550 data sheet have to be
multiplied with 4.
The THR register is of course mapped to offset 0.
For cross-checking this information, the U-Boot driver code at
_drivers/serial/ns16550.c_ becomes handy.

[1] [https://files.pine64.org/doc/datasheet/pine64/Allwinner_A64_User_Manual_V1.0.pdf]

What has the NS16550 data sheet has to say about the THR register?

! Before writing this register the user must ensure that the UART is
! ready to accept data for transmission, for example checking that THR
! Empty flag is set in the LSR

LSR stands for line status register. According to the data sheet, it is
the 5th register. Hence, it should be accessible at the ARM system bus at
offset 5*4 = 0x14. We also learn that the mentioned "Empty" flag hides behind
bit 5 of the LSR.


20 bytes yelling "U"
-------------------

As a preliminary test, let's try to unconditionally write the character 'U'
(ASCII value 0x55) to the THR register in an infinite loop.
The corresponding C program (saving the file as _main.c_) looks as follows:

! int _start()
! {
!   for (;;)
!     *(unsigned long *)0x1c28000 = 'U';
! }

Since we will ultimately have to use Genode's tool chain [1] very soon, now
would be a good time to install it.
The tool chain comes with AARCH64 support. All the utilities can be found at
_/usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/_. One may consider adding this directory
to the shell's PATH variable to avoid the need for typing out this rather
long path. But that is just a matter of convenience.

[1] [https://genode.org/download/tool-chain]

The following invocation of GCC compiles our little C program into an ELF binary:

! $ genode-aarch64-gcc -nostdlib main.c -o serial_test

The '-nostdlib' flag tells the compiler that we don't want to link any
C runtime or default startup code. Let's inspect the result by disassembling
the binary using 'objdump'.

! $ genode-aarch64-objdump -ld serial_test
!
! serial_test:     file format elf64-littleaarch64
!
!
! Disassembly of section .text:
!
! 0000000000400000 <_start>:
! _start():
!   400000:	d2900000 	mov	x0, #0x8000                	// #32768
!   400004:	f2a03840 	movk	x0, #0x1c2, lsl #16
!   400008:	d2800aa1 	mov	x1, #0x55                  	// #85
!   40000c:	f9000001 	str	x1, [x0]
!   400010:	17fffffc 	b	400000 <_start>

Even though the instructions look quite alien to me (not being too familiar
with the AARCH64 ISA at this point), this looks very reasonable. It's good
that the generated code does not rely on a stack pointer because we cannot
assume to have a valid stack. However, the link address 0x400000 is concerning
because the RAM base address of the A64 SoC is not lower than 0x40000000.
Remember, when we looked at Linux' _/proc/iomem_, we spotted the following
line:

! 40000000-bdffffff : System RAM

So we will have to tweak the linker arguments a bit.
From our experiments with U-Boot, we learned that U-Boot's default
load address 0x42000000 lies within this range. We can use the linker argument
'-Ttext' to explicitly specify our desired link address for the text (code)
segment:

! genode-aarch64-gcc -Wl,-Ttext=0x42000000 -nostdlib main.c -o serial_test

The '-Wl,' prefix is merely needed to tell the GCC frontend to pass the
following argument to the linker. With this tweak, the disassembled binary
looks even better:

! Disassembly of section .text:
! 
! 0000000042000000 <_start>:
! _start():
!     42000000:	d2900000 	mov	x0, #0x8000                	// #32768
!     42000004:	f2a03840 	movk	x0, #0x1c2, lsl #16
!     42000008:	d2800aa1 	mov	x1, #0x55                  	// #85
!     4200000c:	f9000001 	str	x1, [x0]
!     42000010:	17fffffc 	b	42000000 <_start>

The 'serial_test' is a complete ELF binary with all kinds of meta data.
For running the instructions on the target, we either need an ELF loader
(U-Boot can of course do that for us) or we climb the hill barefoot.
The latter gives us more control. So let's convert the ELF binary into
a raw binary using 'objcopy'.

! genode-aarch64-objcopy -Obinary serial_test serial_test.img

We named the raw binary _serial_test.img_. Checking its size, it is quite
thrilling to see that it is just 20 bytes of pure usefulness! No overhead.

The next step would be fetching the image via U-Boot's TFTP support. The
TFTP server running my development machine serves the directory
_/var/lib/tftpboot/_. So we have to copy our _serial_test.img_ to this
directory before turning to U-Boot's console:

! => bootp 10.0.0.32:/var/lib/tftpboot/serial_test.img 
! BOOTP broadcast 1
! BOOTP broadcast 2
! BOOTP broadcast 3
! DHCP client bound to address 10.0.0.178 (1100 ms)
! Using ethernet@1c30000 device
! TFTP from server 10.0.0.32; our IP address is 10.0.0.178
! Filename '/var/lib/tftpboot/serial_test.img'.
! Load address: 0x42000000
! Loading: #
! 	 4.9 KiB/s
! done
! Bytes transferred = 20 (14 hex)

It seems our program in its entirety reached its designated place.
Now it's time to take a jump!

! => go 0x42000000
! ## Starting application at 0x42000000 ...
! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...

The serial console gets flooded with U characters. What a joyful moment!

Let's reiterate what we gained by this experiment:

* We know how to compile a custom C program into binary code that works
  on the target.

* We successfully loaded our binary onto the target and passed control
  from the boot loader to our code.

* We got a positive lifesign back from our code.


Evolving from primordial vocals to words
----------------------------------------

Until now, we just violently poked the THR register without listening for the
status of the UART device. To make the program utter words instead of merely
vocals, this ignorance has to stop.

While modifying our program, we have to be careful to not using the stack.
While doing these iterative experiments, a little Makefile becomes handy, which
prints the disassembled program after each compilation:

! CROSS_DEV_PREFIX := /usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/genode-aarch64-
!
! serial_test: main.c
! 	$(CROSS_DEV_PREFIX)gcc -Wl,-Ttext=0x42000000 -nostdlib $< -o $@
! 	$(CROSS_DEV_PREFIX)objdump -ld $@
!
! serial_test.img: serial_test
! 	$(CROSS_DEV_PREFIX)objcopy -Obinary $< $@
!
! test: serial_test.img
! 	cp $< /var/lib/tftpboot/

This little workflow tool not only makes life so much more convenient but it
also documents the use of the various commands for the future me. Since I
regard it as a mere personal tool of mine, I even don't hesitate place
commands like the copying of the image to my TFTP directory in there. Now, by
issuing 'make test', the command takes all the steps of compiling, showing the
assembly code, creating the raw binary, and copying to the TFTP directory all
at once.

Turning back to our actual program, the next baby step would be the output
of a string of characters instead of just one character, like so:

! static char const *text = "Aye aye.\n\r";
! static char const *s;
!
! for (;;)
!   for (s = text; *s; s++)
!     *(unsigned int volatile *)0x1c28000 = *s;

You may wonder why the variables 'text' and 's' are marked as static? If I
made them local variables, which would normally be the better practice, the
compiler would generate a stack frame. For example, by merely changing the
'for' loop to the innocent looking line
! for (char const *s = text; *s; s++)
the corresponding assembly program will generate instructions changing and
de-referencing the stack-pointer register:

!    42000000:	d10043ff 	sub	sp, sp, #0x10
!    42000004:	90000080 	adrp	x0, 42010000 <_start+0x10000>
!    42000008:	91018000 	add	x0, x0, #0x60
!    4200000c:	f9400000 	ldr	x0, [x0]
!    42000010:	f90007e0 	str	x0, [sp, #8]
!    ...

Since we don't have a stack, this is a big no-no!
The 'static' keyword tells the compiler to statically allocate the variable
at the data (or bss) segment of the binary. Speaking of binary segments,
for a bit of a shock, have a look at the binary size now:

! $ ls -la serial_test.img
! -rwxrwxr-x 1 no no 65640 Dez 17 15:30 serial_test.img

Isn't that embarrassing? With our change, we inflated the binary size from
20 bytes to more than 64 KiB. This effect is caused by our use of variables,
which were completely absent in the initial version. The use of at least one
variable prompts the compiler/linker to generate a data segment in addition to
the text (code) segment. By default, the linker places each segment at an
aligned address using a default alignment. On AARCH64, this default alignment
is 64 KiB so that the segment always starts at the beginning of a MMU page
when using virtual memory. Because of this default behavior, our few
instructions are followed by almost 64 KiB of zeros before the variables
start at the next 64 KiB boundary. As of now, we don't use any MMU. So we
could in principle weaken the default alignment. Just for reference, the GCC
argument for defining a segment alignment of 16 bytes would
be '-Wl,-z -Wl,max-page-size=0x10'. Voila! The image shrunk from 64 KiB to
less that 200 bytes. Well, I'll stop the bean counting for now and run this
version of the program:

! ## Starting application at 0x42000000 ...
! Aye aye.
! Aye aye.
! Aye aye.
! Aye aye.
! Aye aye.
! Aye aye.
! Ayeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

[image serial_aaaa]

Even though we can see strings of characters, at one point, the output
regresses to primordial vocals again.
This had to be anticipated since we don't yet check the TX status bit before
writing a new character to the THR register. Interestingly, it worked for
a while, presumably as long as the capacity of the UART's TX FIFO buffer
could swallow the characters.

By the way, while tinkering with devices at such a bare-bones level with
almost no infrastructure, an artificial delay can be accomplished as follows:

! for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
!   asm volatile("nop");

By adding these lines to the body of the outer for loop, we can indeed
observe stable output. But that is of course just a hack. Let's us better
change the code to actually evaluate the status bit.

! int _start()
! {
!   enum {
!     UART_BASE = 0x1c28000,
!
!     THR = UART_BASE,
!     LSR = UART_BASE + 0x14,
!
!     LSR_THRE = (1 << 5)
!   };
!
!   /* static is needed to prevent the compiler from creating a stack frame */
!   static char const *text = "Aye aye.";
!
!   for (;;) {
!
!     static char const *s;
!
!     for (s = text; *s; s++) {
!
!       /* poll 'TX Holding Register Empty' bit */
!       while (((*(unsigned int volatile *)LSR) & LSR_THRE) == 0);
!
!       *(unsigned int volatile *)THR = *s;
!     }
!   }
! }

Note the amount of lipstick I applied to the code.

* Adding a comment here and there.
* Grouping things with vertical whitespace.
* Using enum values to give magic values tangible names.

I agree that this may be a little excessive for such a temporary test program.
But keep in mind that I wrote it not for my present me, but for you, and my
future me. Also note that I removed the line break from the 'text', which
has no reason other than making the following picture more pretty.

[image serial_aye]
  Infinite obedience

Thanks to listening to the UART's TX status bit, the output has become
reliable. So now, we have a minimal and known-to-work blueprint for
our upcoming kernel's UART driver. With this primitive way to get information
out of the board, we can turn our attention to the kernel-porting work, which
is the topic of the next section.
