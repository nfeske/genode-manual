One Platform driver to rule them all
====================================

In the previous section, we
exercised direct-device access from user-level components. In Genode systems
beyond such toy scenarios, however, it would be irresponsible to follow the
path of allowing arbitrary drivers to access any device willy-nilly. Our call
for discipline and rigidity is answered by the _(rising drum roll)_ platform
driver.

Let's recap the scenario of the previous article.

[tikz img/pio_device_core_access]

Our user-level test program created connections to core's services for
accessing memory-mapped I/O registers and receiving notifications for device
interrupts. The choice of physical register addresses and the GIC interrupt
number was up to the test program. So in principle, our program could access
any part of the platform by just requesting it. Hence, the mere fact that the
driver code has the form of a regular user-level component does not buy us a
security gain per se. To benefit from Genode's architecture, we need to
rigidly limit the reach of each individual driver to the smallest-possible set
of device resources.

Remember, even though we want to use drivers, we distrust them. Consequently,
besides enforcing access control, we generally don't want to expose
system-global information to such untrusted components, asking questions
like: Does a driver even need to know the physical address of a memory-mapped
I/O register? Does it need to know the GIC interrupt number of the device
it is driving? The perhaps surprising answer is that - no! - many drivers can
happily do their job without any knowledge about these technicalities. All a
driver needs to know is _how to speak_ to a device of a certain type, not
where a particular instance of a device is located and how it is wired up.
This principled approach leads to a clear-cut separation of driver logic from
parametrization.


Platform driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To separate the concerns of parametrization and access control from the
device drivers, Genode employs the so-called _platform driver_ as a level
of indirection between core's services and the individual drivers.
The platform driver has a global view over all device resources and follows
a configured policy to partition those resources between its clients.
Each session to the platform service can comprise potentially multiple devices,
depending on the configured policy.

[tikz img/pio_device_platform_access]

To integrate the notion the platform driver into our existing scenario of
accessing general-purpose I/O pins via a to-be-developed PIO device driver,
it is best to first sketch a run script that mirrors the picture above.
We have to find a suitable name and location within our source tree for our
designated driver component.

The naming of driver components within Genode follows the pattern
! <device-or-platform>_<driver-type>_drv
For example, the 'imx8_fb_drv' is a
framebuffer (fb) driver for the 'i.MX8' SoC. In our case of a PIO driver for
the Allwinner A64 SoC, the name 'a64_pio_drv' is a sensible choice.

Even though there is no strict convention of the directory where a driver is
located, drivers usually reside in a subdirectory of _src/drivers/_ that
corresponds to the primary purpose of the driver. E.g., framebuffer drivers
are located at _src/drivers/framebuffer/_. Our designated driver drives
GPIO pins. So I settled on placing it at _src/driver/pin/a64/_ within the
genode-allwinner repository [1].
With the complicated naming-things-topics behind us, let's turn our attention
to the run script, appropriately named _a64_pio_drv.run_.

[1] [https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner].

# Building the components including the platform driver along with our new
  custom driver.

  ! build { core init drivers/platform drivers/pin/a64 }

# Creating a boot directory with the configuration of the init component.

  ! create_boot_directory
  !
  ! install_config {
  !   <config>
  !     <parent-provides>
  !       <service name="LOG"/>
  !       <service name="PD"/>
  !       <service name="CPU"/>
  !       <service name="ROM"/>
  !       <service name="IO_MEM"/>
  !       <service name="IRQ"/>
  !     </parent-provides>
  !
  !     <default caps="100"/>
  !     ...
  !
  !   </config>
  ! }

  At this time the scenario consists of only two components, namely the
  platform driver and our PIO driver. The <start> node for the platform
  driver is particularly interesting.

  ! <start name="platform_drv">
  !   <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
  !   <provides> <service name="Platform"/> </provides>
  !   <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
  !   <config>
  !     <device name="pio">
  !       <io_mem address="0x1c20800" size="0x400"/>
  !       <irq number="43"/>
  !     </device>
  !     <policy label="a64_pio_drv -> ">
  !       <device name="pio"/>
  !     </policy>
  !   </config>
  ! </start>

  The routing rule states that the platform driver is permitted to
  open arbitrary sessions to core, including IRQ and IO_MEM. There
  are no restrictions.

  The <provides> declaration states that this component offers a "Platform"
  service.

  The <config> node tells the platform driver about the known device
  resources. We declare the existence of a single "pio" device that
  features one memory-mapped I/O range and the GIC interrupt 43.
  You may recall those values from Section [Device access from the user level].

  The <config> node also tells the platform driver about the access-control
  policy applied to clients that connect to the platform service.
  In the case at hand, we dictate that a client labeled as "a64_pio_drv -> "
  gets access to the "pio" device. You may wonder about the trailing
  '->' part of the label. The part before the arrow is hard-wired by the
  parent of the 'a64_pio_drv' and thereby reflects the identity of the
  client in a way that cannot be forged by the client. The part after the
  arrow is controlled by the client. The client can use this part to provide
  hints about the purpose of the session. So a client that creates multiple
  sessions to the same server can express the intention behind those sessions.
  In our case, this client-controlled part remains unused.

  The <start> node for our designated PIO driver looks as follows.

  ! <start name="a64_pio_drv">
  !   <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
  !   <route>
  !     <service name="ROM"> <parent/> </service>
  !     <service name="CPU"> <parent/> </service>
  !     <service name="PD">  <parent/> </service>
  !     <service name="LOG"> <parent/> </service>
  !     <service name="Platform"> <child name="platform_drv"/> </service>
  !   </route>
  !   <config/>
  ! </start>

  Let me bring the <route> node to your attention. In contrast to the
  wildcard rule <any-service> used for the platform driver, the
  rules for the PIO driver state explicit permissions. From these rules,
  we can immediately infer the potential reach of the component.

  The driver is permitted to connect to the platform driver. That's
  what we want.
  It is also able to use core's ROM, CPU, PD, and LOG services, which provide
  the fundamental ingredients for executing the program.

  Most importantly, no other service is reachable. In particular, the
  direct use of core's IRQ and IO_MEM is out of question. The only way
  to access a device is the platform driver that imposes its policy.

# Building the boot image containing the ELF binaries for the components and
  executing the scenario.

  ! build_boot_image { core ld.lib.so init platform_drv a64_pio_drv }
  !
  ! run_genode_until forever

To exercise the interplay between the designated PIO driver with the platform
driver, it is a good idea to transplant the _test/pin_state_ program of the
previous section from the use of core's services to the use of the platform
driver. The following snippet highlights the important changes.

! #include <platform_session/device.h>
! ...
!
! struct Pio_driver::Main
! {
!    Env &_env;
!
!    Platform::Connection _platform { _env };
!
!    Platform::Device _device { _platform };
!
!    struct Pio : Platform::Device::Mmio
!    {
!       struct Pb_cfg0 : Register<0x24, 32>
!       {
!          ...
!       };
!
!       ...
!
!       Pio(Platform::Device &device) : Mmio(device)
!       {
!          ...
!       }
!    };
!    ...
!    Pio _pio { _device };
!    ...
! };

* The API for using the platform driver becomes available via
  ! #include <platform_session/device.h>

* A session to the platform service is established by creating an instance of
  a 'Platform::Connection' passing the Genode environment as argument.
  ! Platform::Connection _platform { _env };
  By passing the '_env', we explicitly give our consent that
  the 'Platform::Connection' can have global side effects such as the
  communication with the outside world.

* Access to one particular device of the platform session can be obtained by
  creating an instance of a 'Platform::Device'.
  ! Platform::Device _device { _platform };
  When called with only the 'Platform::Connection' as argument, the device
  refers to the first - and in our case only - device of the platform
  session. In cases where multiple devices appear grouped in one platform
  session, a second argument allows for the selection of the device.

* The memory-mapped registers of the PIO device are represented by a
  custom 'Pio' type that inherits the 'Platform::Device::Mmio' type.
  ! struct Pio : Platform::Device::Mmio
  The constructor takes a 'Platform::Device' and an optional
  index as arguments.
  ! Pio _pio { _device };
  If no index is provided, it refers to the first <io_mem> resources as
  declared in the platform-driver's configuration.

* Thanks to the inherited 'Platform::Device::Mmio' type, the individual
  registers can be accessed in the same way as we did in the previous
  article.

Note that in contrast to the previous examples, the code is void of physical
addresses. Now, those addresses are the business of the platform driver only.


Session interfaces for accessing pins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ultimately want to allow multiple programs to interact with different GPIO
pins. So our PIO driver must evolve into a server component that allows
clients to interact with pins. Analogously to how the platform driver
safeguards the access to device resources by different - mutually
distrusting - device drivers, the PIO driver's job will be the safeguarding of
GPIO pins.

Traditionally, Genode features the "Gpio" session interface
for this purpose. This interface allows a client to access an individual pin.
Once assigned to a pin, the session grants the client the full responsibility
for the pin. In particular the direction of the I/O pin is laid into the hands
of the client.
We later realized that the wiring and thereby the direction of a pin is
ultimately a board-level decision. Wrongly operating an input pin in output
mode can easily result in a short-circuit. Therefore, the client of an
individual pin should better not be burdened with the responsibility to
control the pin direction or pull resistors. To address this concern, it is
best to split the roles of GPIO pins into clear-cut session interfaces. Those
roles are:

# The sensing of the state of a GPIO pin, e.g., detecting whether a button
  is pressed or not: operating a pin as an input signal. This role is now
  covered by the "Pin_state" session interface with the single RPC function

  ! bool state() const;

  By calling this function, the client can request the state of the pin.
  That's it.

# Controlling the signal level of a pin: operating a pin as an output signal.
  This role is now addressed by the "Pin_control" session interface that
  provides an interface of only one rather unsurprising RPC function

  ! void state(bool);

# Receiving a notification of a change of the signal level of a GPIO pin:
  operating a pin as an interrupt source. This role can be represented by
  Genode's existing IRQ session interface - the same interface as provided
  by Genode's core for GIC interrupts.

_In principle, there may exist legitimate use cases for controlling the_
_direction on an I/O pin by a client, e.g., for implementing a bit-banging_
_driver for a single-wire-bus. However, in practice, we haven't observed_
_such use cases with modern SoC's. Should such a tristate use case pop up,_
_we may address it by dedicated session type._

At the time of writing, the "Pin_state" and "Pin_control" session interfaces
still reside local to the genode-allwinner repository.
After a period of time-testing, they will eventually become part of the Genode
API, replacing the traditional "Gpio" session interface.


PIO device driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The A64 PIO driver implements the three session interfaces outlined above.
It resides at _src/drivers/pin/a64_ within the genode-allwinner repository.
The accompanied README covers the details about its use and configuration.

Similar to how the platform-driver configuration declares device resources
like IRQs and memory-mapped I/O regions, the PIO driver's configuration
declares pins.

! <config>
!   <out name="led"    bank="B" index="2" default="on"/>
!   <in  name="button" bank="H" index="8" pull="up" irq="edges"/>
!   ...
! </config>

Here we see the declaration of an output pin named "led" and an input pin
"button". The 'bank' and 'index' denote the physical location of the pin at
the SoC. Further pin parameters are expressed as attributes. For example,
in the absence of a "Pin_control" client for the "led", the led is set to
state "on" according to the 'default' attribute.

Since the A64 PIO device subsumes GPIO functionality as well as I/O MUX
functionality, the driver also offers the selection of pin functions
beyond <in> and <out>.

A few technical tidbits and caveats I encountered during its development are
worth sharing:

:Device-register interaction:

  The actual interplay of the driver with the hardware registers is completely
  covered by the code found in _pio.h_ [1].
  Genode's 'Mmio' framework API makes this code strikingly simple, almost
  self-describing. There is no manual bit fiddling to be found, thanks to the
  wonderful 'Register_array'.

:Code organization:

  I deliberately split the code into a boring and an interesting part.

  The boring part models the SoC-specific terminology as a bunch of
  corresponding C++ types. In _types.h_ [2],
  one can find types for any term we deal with - however boring it is. Most of
  these types have a local 'Value' type that is as rigid as possible. E.g.,
  the 'Pull' type contains an enum with the values DISABLE, UP, and DOWN as
  the 'Value' type. The degrees of freedom mirror the information found in the
  SoC manual. Each type is equipped with a class function 'from_xml' that
  encodes the knowledge of how values of the type relate to XML
  representation. Some of the types go as far as deliberately disabling any
  means to construct instances of the type without using 'from_xml' by
  deleting the default constructor. This way, program-global invariants of the
  type can be enforced at a single place. The boring code makes up the
  biggest part of the driver. This is good because with "boring" I mean
  simple and easy to assess for correctness.

  The interesting part lives in the _main.cc_ [3] file where all the strings
  are coming together.

:Stumbling blocks:

  Quite a bit of time went wasted because of silly mistakes of mine.

  Sometimes I went too hastily over the SoC documentation without double
  checking.
  In particular, I allowed myself be become misled by a table in the SoC
  documentation [4] at page 376 where I wrongly identified patterns that do
  not exist.
  In one part of the table, the symbol 'n' _seemingly_ refers to a zero-indexed
  value corresponding to GPIO banks in alphabetic order. Some lines below
  (at the Pn_INT_*) definitions, the 'n' refers only to a few banks, namely
  'B', 'G', 'H'. I wrongly assumed the same linearity of register layouts
  to apply for both parts of the table. In reality, 'n' must just be read
  as a shorthand of "some value". Note to myself: Double check my assumptions
  each time I'm overconfident that _I got it_.

  Because of my prolonged intimacy with pin 2 at bank B, I lost sight
  of the other banks, in particular the fact that each bank is wired up
  with a distinct GIC interrupt. Once I tried to receive interrupts for
  pin 8 at bank H, I first struggled to get the interrupt mechanism to work,
  until I realized that bank H interrupts end up at GIC IRQ 53, not 43.
  In fact, the "pio" device in the platform driver configuration now looks
  like this:

  ! <device name="pio">
  !   <io_mem address="0x1c20800" size="0x400"/>
  !   <irq number="43"/> <!-- Port B -->
  !   <irq number="49"/> <!-- Port G -->
  !   <irq number="53"/> <!-- Port H -->
  ! </device>

:Implementation of dynamic re-configurability:

  For maintaining the internal data model of the pin-state configuration,
  the driver employs Genode's 'List_model' utility. By using this utility,
  the creation and updating of such a data model from XML data becomes very
  simple. It comes down to providing hook functions for creating, destroying,
  matching, and updating model items.

  It is worth noting that the driver configuration is not static but it can be
  dynamically adjusted during runtime. So in principle, we can attain a
  blinking LED by the sole means of re-configuring the driver.

Dynamic configuration testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Wait what!?_

If blinking an LED by reconfiguring the PIO driver sounds as irresistible to
you as to me, follow me for a moment.

For test-driving the dynamic configuration handling of components like the
A64 PIO driver, there exists a handy utility component called _dynamic_rom_,
which provides a ROM service that feeds the client with different version
of ROM content over time. Here is how a <start> node of a dynamic_rom server
looks like.

! <start name="dynamic_rom">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!   <provides> <service name="ROM"/> </provides>
!   <route>
!     <service name="Timer"> <child name="timer"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
!   <config>
!     <rom name="config">
!       <inline description="LED off">
!         <config>
!           <out name="led" bank="B" index="2" default="off"/>
!         </config>
!       </inline>
!       <sleep milliseconds="1000"/>
!       <inline description="LED on">
!         <config>
!           <out name="led" bank="B" index="2" default="on"/>
!         </config>
!       </inline>
!       <sleep milliseconds="1000"/>
!     </rom>
!   </config>
! </start>

The <rom> node within its configuration defines a PIO <config>. After 1
second, the <config> is replaced with a new version where the 'default'
attribute of the <out> pin is toggled. After one more second, the
first <config> becomes active again.

The remaining piece of the puzzle is feeding the ROM provided by the
dynamic_rom server as config ROM to the a64_pio_drv driver. This can
be achieved by the following routing rule in the <start> node of the
a64_pio_drv component.

! <start name="a64_pio_drv">
!   ...
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label="config">
!       <child name="dynamic_rom"/> </service>
!     ...
!   </route>
! </start>

By wiring up the driver configuration to the dynamic_rom we can see the
LED happily blinking even without any "Pio_control" client present.

The dynamic_rom server is handy utility in many testing situations. Besides
issuing time-triggered configuration updates, it can be used to mock
system-state changes that are normally driven by real components or sensory
input that is difficult to fabricate manually.


Cascaded authorities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to the configuration concept of the platform driver, the
pin-declarations of the PIO driver configuration are followed by a policy part
of the configuration that associates clients with pins.

! <config>
!   ...
!   <policy label_prefix="pin_event ->" pin="button"/>
!   <policy label_prefix="pin_pulse ->" pin="led"/>
! </config>

This configuration assigns the "led" pin to the program "pin_pulse", and the
"button" to the program "pin_event". Note that - like the pin declarations -
these assignments can be dynamically changed by the means of configuration
updates.

The "pin_pulse" component uses the "Pin_control" session to drive the digital
signal of an LED with a pulse-width-modulated pattern.
Effectively, the program toggles the LED 200 times per second
while adjusting the relation of the durations of the low and high signal
levels over time. The result is a nice breathing effect.

The "pin_event" component watches the state of a pin using a combination of an
IRQ session and a "Pin_state" session. Each time when the signal changes, an
IRQ is triggered, which prompts the component to obtain the pin state by
calling 'Pin_state::state'.

The component composition of the scenario looks as follows.

[tikz img/pio_device_driver]

The higher up we get, the less influential the components become. Whereas the
kernel has ultimate authority over everything, the reach of the pin-pulse
component is limited to the control of the output signal of a single GPIO pin
only.

As indicated by the coloring of the components, policy and mechanisms are
nicely separated. The pin-pulse component does not even know which pin it is
driving. It merely contains the logic needed to modulate the PWM pattern on a
digital output signal. At the bottom end of the picture, the core / kernel
component does have no interpretation of physical device addresses or IRQ
numbers. It is indifferent regarding GIC IRQ number 43 and free from policy.
The policy is encapsulated in the forms of the platform and PIO driver
components, each respectively applying a policy at a _useful_ level of
abstraction.


Integrated test scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final version of the _a64_pio_drv.run_ script [1] contains the
combinations of the various fragments discussed above.
It test-drives the dynamic re-configurability of the PIO driver along with
the "Pin_state", "Pin_control", and IRQ session interfaces.

[1] [https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner/blob/master/run/a64_pio_drv.run]

For the test of the GPIO input, I selected pin 8 of bank H. This pin is
accessible at the Euler connector at pin 10 of the Pine-A64-LTS board.
The board has a button labeled "power" just besides the reset button.
Although this "power" button is connected to the AXP803 power management
chip, it doesn't appear to have any effect when pressed while the board is
on. According to the board schematics,
the button happens to be also wired to pin 5 of the smaller 10-pin Euler
header. I figured that I can thereby feed the button state to the GPIO pin
H8 be connecting pin 5 of the small Euler header with pin 10 of the large
Euler header. The signal is active-low, which can be explained by the
schematics that shows that the button pulls the PWR_ON signal to ground when
pressed. Long story short, with this wiring in place, the power button can
be observed via GPIO H8. The GPIO pin B2 can be connected to an LED as
we did for the test/pin_control example described in the previous article.
